1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:07,692
So in this video, we're going to be discussing
Q&A videos. So Q&A videos are another one of

2
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:13,415
my favorite content formats. And as the name
sounds, somebody asks you a question, and you

3
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:19,277
answer that in a video. So that's what you call
a Q&A video. So these videos can either be

4
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:25,960
recorded in, say, your workspace, or it can
be recorded in, say, a meeting setup of somebody

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,910
asking you a question, then you answering them,
and both of you being in the video, or it can

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,491
be like on a webinar, or it can be at a conference
or event that you're speaking at, and somebody

7
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:38,472
from the audience is asking your question, and
you're answering it, and you record that and

8
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:44,714
publish that as a video. All of these are Q&A
videos, but let's first take a look at the

9
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:54,117
entire process of creating Q&A videos first.
So let me move back to ClickUp and walk you

10
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:59,886
through the content management process for a
Q&A video. So this is the template card for

11
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:05,589
Q&A videos. So obviously the process starts
with you adding an idea. You need to create

12
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:12,231
duplicate this card, update the status to outlines,
and then add the idea in the outlines and beef

13
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:17,213
out the outline slowly. But let's take a look
at how the process looks. So the process is

14
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:23,016
almost exactly the same like an experiential
video, experiential story video. So the content

15
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:28,842
manager adds an outline or the copywriter adds
an outline. And then the copywriter, idea of

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:35,025
the Q&A video is approved. These need to be
discussed on the content edition calls with

17
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:40,687
the executive, and the executive will answer
what is the answer to that question. So whatever

18
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:45,509
question it is, that is the outline, and the
executive will give you information on what

19
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:50,271
their answer is, and you can document that in the 
outline and then start creating the content in the 

20
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:57,590
draft stage. So in this stage, you go ahead and create 
a bunch of elements. So the elements will include

21
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:03,274
the video script for the Q&A video, the post copy,
the thumbnail caption. So the thumbnail caption

22
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:09,760
in most cases for Q&A videos will be the question
presented in an attention-grabbing format. So

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,344
let's take a look at the example so that you
understand how this is done. So this has a

24
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:19,608
thumbnail image. So the thumbnail image of this
video includes a question like "What's the most underrated

25
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:25,132
skill to succeed in your career?" and a question
mark. So you can include a thumbnail which

26
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:30,096
includes the question. and then the video editor
can go ahead and create a thumbnail for you.

27
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:35,581
But then we move on to the remaining steps, and
after you update the statuses of the subtask

28
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:40,966
and the parent task, it moves on to the content
manager's queue who reviews all these elements,

29
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:46,390
proceeds to the executive's approval queue who
reviews all these elements, may suggest feedback,

30
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,114
in which case it moves back in the process.
But if it's good to go, it moves forward in

31
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:58,551
the process, which is when the executive will
record the video. and send it to the video

32
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:03,813
editor who will edit the video, create the thumbnail
image and so on, and send it to the content

33
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:09,095
manager again for approval. And if it's good
to go, it will go to the executive queue again

34
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:13,237
for approval. And then finally, it will get
to be ready to be posted stage for the user

35
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:17,658
profile and the company page. Q&A videos ideally
can be posted on both the user profile as well

36
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:23,761
as the company page. So that is the process
for ClickUp. And now let's take a quick look

37
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:30,474
at how to ideate Q&A videos. So the most interesting
thing about Q&A videos is there's tons of ways

38
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:34,858
in which you can come up with ideas. But one
of the best ways to come up with good questions

39
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:42,365
is a tool called answerthepublic.com. So that's
answerthepublic.com without spaces. So you

40
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:46,528
can enter any keyword in here. So, for example,
in my case, I've entered "construction," and they

41
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:54,471
will give you like, I don't know, it's like
1000 questions for different topics and questions

42
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:59,455
that are being asked on Google and different
social media platforms. This is one of the

43
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:06,200
only sources that you need for that specific
topic. You can even click on any of these questions

44
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:13,365
and it'll pull up a Google search, and you can
collect more information about that specific

45
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:17,988
question and add more ideas. But if you zoom
in here, you can see that all of these are

46
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:24,507
different topics. So, can construction be done
on Sunday? Can construction adhesive be removed?

47
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:31,169
Can construction cause allergies? Can construction
make you sick? So, when construction starts?

48
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:38,110
So when is construction holiday 2022? So all
of these are different topics about different

49
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:42,352
areas in the construction industry as a whole.
If you find that these questions are not relevant,

50
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:45,312
you can refine the topic a little bit more.
So you can say something like "construction

51
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:51,058
project tracking" or "construction risk management"
or "construction tracking construction vendors,"

52
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:55,680
so on. So based on whatever topics, keywords
you want to enter, you'll get different, different

53
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,422
questions about this. So this is one way to
come up with really good questions. The other

54
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:06,565
way is to use Reddit. So all I need to do is
enter a keyword and search Reddit, and Google

55
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:12,488
will pull up different threads in Reddit that
have both the questions and answers. So a lot

56
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:16,529
of users will come in and if you ask a question,
they will drop comments with the answers as

57
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:23,121
well. and some will ask follow-up questions
in here. So this is an excellent way to find

58
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:23,663
really good.

59
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,593
ideas for Q&A videos, and another example is
Quora. So Quora is another Q&A website. You

60
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:37,056
can search for like Quora construction risks
and here you go, a thread about hazards in

61
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:42,879
construction work, major risks involved in construction,
in working in construction site. What is the

62
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,921
risk management in construction projects? So
you can go through these, look for like good

63
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:54,898
answers and you can find relevant questions
from Quora as well very quickly. So that sums

64
00:05:54,938 --> 00:06:00,720
up the ideation process involved, how to find
ideas and document them in the ClickUp task.

65
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,641
So you need to add them in outlines and proceed
with the rest of the process and ask them to

66
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:11,243
the executives on the content ideation calls.
But how do you go about creating the post?

67
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:15,984
Now, we don't have outlines for Q&A videos for
the simple reason that questions and answers,

68
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:22,222
it's a very simple format. All you need are
hooks for creating a Q&A video. Questions and

69
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:28,644
answers can be formatted in different ways.
So take a look at the lesson on the elements

70
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:33,305
that make good LinkedIn copy, where we explain
what are the different types of formatting

71
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:38,266
that you should use. So that is a helpful lesson
for optimizing Q&A videos, but specifically

72
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:43,988
for like the content for Q&A videos, you don't
really need outlines. You can just ask the

73
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:48,569
question in the hook in an interesting fashion.
So go through the hooks, make sure the hook

74
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:55,352
is really good. And then after that, you can
just add the answer in the post copy in an

75
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:59,474
interesting fashion in the video script, present
the answer in an interesting fashion and just

76
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:05,456
make sure that the formatting in the post

 copy,
the paragraph formatting or the skimmable text

77
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:10,599
content formatting is in the correct fashion.
We have a separate lesson about how to create

78
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:14,340
content formats, content in different formats,
which is one of the primary lessons in this

79
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,238
section. So just take a look at that video.
You'll understand how to format it well. But

80
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,221
Q&A videos are one of the easiest content formats
to create for the simple reason that when you

81
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:27,384
can find questions and answers everywhere, you
just need to answer them and get the videos

82
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:32,528
recorded and publish them. So that's it for
Q&A videos. See you in the next video.
