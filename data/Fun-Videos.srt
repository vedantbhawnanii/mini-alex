1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,331
So most of us assume that funny content, like
we share on TikTok and like we share on Instagram

2
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:13,973
Reels and YouTube Shorts are not really a good
fit for LinkedIn. But that's not true. In fact,

3
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:18,835
it is one of the best performing video content
formats on LinkedIn. When you add humor to

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:24,157
posts and when you add a fun element to posts,
it stands out from the rest of the boring content

5
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:28,058
that you typically see on the LinkedIn feed
completely about business topics. So I'm going

6
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:34,121
to just play this video so that you understand
what this is about. So this guy is on his way

7
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:38,864
to bother 40 more LinkedIn connections about
positivity and encouragement. So look at that.

8
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:45,808
He's just playing with his dog. That's it. It's,
it's a five second video. So it takes a bit

9
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:52,692
of time to refer to like, say, like record it
and then edit it, you have like a super short

10
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:57,879
post copy, but that's it. That's what you call
a fun video. Now fun videos can be created

11
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:03,002
on the most mundane, irrelevant topics. You
just need to think about them creatively. So

12
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:11,148
this is more about how open you'd be to recording
interesting, funny videos. You will be able

13
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:19,554
to find more interesting examples of fun videos
in the IG Content Outlines book. In the IG

14
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:23,957
Content Outlines book, we explain more fun videos.
You can take more examples over there. But.

15
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:30,899
That is it for fun videos. You need to create
the script. The process for fun videos is almost

16
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,621
exactly the same as that of experiential videos.
So there is an editing process involved in

17
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:42,002
it because you record the videos yourself. You're
not taking third party content and just publishing

18
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:46,304
it and there is repurposing or resharing it.
You're recording your own videos. So the process

19
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:52,185
is very similar to that of experiential story
videos where a video script is created and

20
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:55,539
you record the video. You don't need to even
say anything in the video. It can be video

21
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:59,021
scripts where you don't say anything. You just
explain what you do, the actions that you're

22
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:05,625
taking in the video script. But to a large extent,
this depends on the creativity of the copywriter

23
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:10,747
to understand what are your limitations with
the recording, what are the executors' limitations

24
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:14,209
with the recording, how much effort they can
put into it, and what kind of videos they can

25
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:18,192
quickly record using their smartphone. You don't
need to use huge recording setups for this.

26
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:23,655
A smartphone or an iPhone is more than enough.
But then once the copywriter gets an understanding

27
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:28,379
of what type of videos you can record, how much
time you can spend into the recording, they

28
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:33,983
can come up with a quick script with the scenes
that are to be recorded. And then they can

29
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:39,086
create a video script for it. And then it follows
the usual approval queue that we have for video

30
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:45,551
content formats, where the video script and
the post copy is created by the copywriter,

31
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:50,570
the content manager reviews it, the executive
then reviews it. Then the executive goes ahead

32
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,332
and records it, uploads it to Drive and sends
it to the video editor for editing. The video

33
00:02:55,352 --> 00:03:01,955
editor then creates the video and then sends
it to the content manager for approval and

34
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:05,756
then the executive again reviews it after the
content manager's approval and then finally

35
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:10,438
it moves to the ready to be posted queues for
user profile and the company pages. Very simple

36
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:17,781
and they're very easy to create but at the same
time hooks are again important. The video keeps

37
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:24,228
playing. So hooks are again important for this
content format. So it's important that you

38
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:30,811
take a look at the hook section and optimize
the hooks for this content format as well.

39
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:36,494
And you can find the hooks in the content marketing
modules workbook. Just search for 100 viral

40
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,635
hooks in the doc and you should be able to find
it quickly.
