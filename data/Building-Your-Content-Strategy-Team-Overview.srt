1
00:00:01,378 --> 00:00:07,884
So in this module, we kickstart building the
actual content strategy based on all the analysis

2
00:00:07,904 --> 00:00:11,707
we did earlier and the team we need to execute
the strategy. So we're gonna build both the

3
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:17,433
strategy, kickstart it as well as hire a team
and build up a team of existing internal team

4
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:22,137
members or external team members that can be
used to have the different tasks in the strategy.

5
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:29,703
Now, the first thing that we need to do. is
how to choose your content persona and select

6
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:34,186
different content formats and choose your own
content formats to build a content calendar

7
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:38,548
that you can use to decide on which content
formats you should start working on and start

8
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:43,231
assigning those content tasks to your team members.
But in order to do that you need to understand

9
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:47,974
the different roles in our LinkedIn content
marketing team. So we'll dive into that and

10
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:51,276
I'll explain what are the different roles in
a LinkedIn content marketing team like content

11
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:55,770
manager, copyrighter, video editor, graphic
designer. executive assistant and the main

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,753
executive who will be managed, who will be like
the responsible, the owner of the process and

13
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:06,436
what their individual responsibilities are.
And then we will also dive into the recruiting,

14
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:11,179
hiring and onboarding processes for each of
these team members so that you can onboard

15
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:17,182
them, hire them and onboard them into your LinkedIn
content marketing team. And then we move on

16
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:22,405
to the ClickUp Content Board, which is the best
content management system that you can use

17
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:28,012
for your content management work. for LinkedIn,
why you need it, why it's important, and then

18
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:33,536
templated content management board in ClickUp
that we built for you with templates of every

19
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:38,900
single content format that we teach for you
in the program. Now, after that, we'll show

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,583
you how to organize content addition calls and
show you how to use them to review, ideate,

21
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:49,287
and brainstorm really good content in a structured
fashion in a repetitive manner. So this will

22
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:55,811
be done every week. And finally, we'll jump
into how to Go about activating your network

23
00:01:58,193 --> 00:02:03,997
and activate your existing first degree network
to get increased the reach of your post. So

24
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:10,161
this is a growth hacking part of the strategy.
We do this to make sure that our network is

25
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:15,345
primed and the algorithm is primed so that more
users see our content when we actually go ahead

26
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:15,905
and publish it.

27
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:23,127
After this, we jumped into the last part of
this module, which is the biggest part, but

28
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:29,890
this part is all about content formats. So there's
about 20 different content formats that we're

29
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,352
teaching you in the program, including experiences,
stories, videos, tips and tricks, videos, Q&A

30
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:39,894
videos, resource giveaways, slide posts. So
all of these are interesting content formats

31
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:45,636
that you can use for your LinkedIn account.
And we'll walk you through first the content

32
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:51,379
management of how the... creation and the publishing
and the promotion process. Each of these content

33
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:55,241
formats can be handled within the template cards
in ClickUp. We'll walk you through the template

34
00:02:55,281 --> 00:03:00,484
cards. Then we'll talk about how to ideate these
content formats on ideation calls or by a manual

35
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:06,147
research. And we'll finally talk about how to
go about creating those with the help of outlines,

36
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:12,531
hooks, formatting tips, and so on. So that's
it for the overview. This section should take,

37
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:17,073
based on like how much, how many content formats
you want to experiment with, this section,

38
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:26,520
should take about. seven to eight hours to completely
finish the initial work, but then you'll have

39
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,046
weekly recurring work based on how much content
you're creating and the tasks that your team

40
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:35,452
will be spending on each of the creation of
each of those content formats. So all in all,

41
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:43,155
it should take in between. 15 to 20 hours in
total every week to execute all the work that

42
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:50,777
we're teaching you with this process. But this
is the start of your LinkedIn content marketing

43
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:55,199
after all the analysis and set up work that
we did. So let's get excited.
