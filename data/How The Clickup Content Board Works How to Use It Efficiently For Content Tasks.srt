1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:08,595
So how do you structure your content management
process for efficiency? Now improper content

2
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:16,601
management is the hash one reason for content
failure. It's easy to assume that content marketing

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:23,918
strategy failures or lack of results from content
marketing happens because of improper. internal

4
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:27,619
processes or because you are not able to create
content on the right topics or because the

5
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:32,640
team members or the copywriters or the content
managers are not skilled enough but the actual

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:39,602
truth is that improper and inefficient content
management or lack of a process of proper content

7
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:47,204
management is the number one cause of failure
when you are not generating results from content

8
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:53,788
marketing. Now let me explain that for a minute.
There are There are three quick topics to discuss

9
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:59,758
here. So the first one is people and team members.
The second one is consistency. And the third

10
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:06,915
one are content formats. Now in a scenario where
you're creating your own content and you're

11
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:11,197
reviewing it yourself, you're editing it yourself,
you're approving it yourself and you're publishing

12
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:17,059
it, promoting it yourself, you don't really
need a very robust content management process.

13
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:21,301
So if you're handling the process end to end,
you can simply track it in a Google Sheet,

14
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:26,963
that's more than enough. But... If you have
a cotton strategy that you're trying to scale

15
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:32,966
up where you're creating cotton consistently
in multiple cotton formats that require the

16
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:38,769
input of multiple team members, let's take an
example. So assume you're creating a video

17
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,753
where somebody is scripting the video for you
and you're recording the video and you're sending

18
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:52,137
it to a video editor who edits the video, which
is then reviewed by a cotton manager for revision

19
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:52,857
suggestions.

20
00:01:56,042 --> 00:02:00,763
post copy corrections and so on and then sent
to you for approval and you finally take a

21
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:05,085
look at it and you approve it, give the final
approval for the publishing and then a team

22
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:11,546
member goes and publishes it on your LinkedIn
page and promotes the content and replies to

23
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:17,808
the comments and drag the leads coming in. Now
a process like these requires the input of

24
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:26,044
multiple team members and it is very difficult
handle this in a simple Google Sheet. What

25
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:32,650
you need to solve this is a content management
system that has the ability to track statuses

26
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:39,075
of multiple content pieces, the ability to handle
different process workflows. Say for example,

27
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:45,641
the process workflow for an experiential story
video is different from the process workflow

28
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:50,765
for a Q&A video. We will get into these formats
later on so that you understand better but

29
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:56,122
different kinds of content formats have different
process workflows. The content workflow for

30
00:02:57,023 --> 00:03:02,488
a text post is very different from the content
workflow for a video, any video. The content

31
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:14,478
workflow for a text post is very different from
that of a carousel that involves the inputs

32
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:21,320
of a designer who designs the carousel on the
slide post. Now are these the only challenges?

33
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:28,172
No. We need to be able to categorize each of
the content pieces into different buckets based

34
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:33,420
on content formats, like experience stories,
or slide posts, Q&A videos, and social media

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,877
and so on. we need to be able to search and
filter for different content pieces as needed.

36
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:45,842
So over time as you build your content database
and you've published a couple dozens of content

37
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:50,626
and you want to search a particular post, you
need to have a sheet or a content management

38
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:57,471
system or a dashboard that is able to, where
you're able to quickly find the content piece

39
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:02,916
that you're looking for. And in the creation
of each content piece, there are subtasks,

40
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:09,318
say for example, the entire content creation
process is not handled by one person. So there

41
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:13,642
are sub-cores in it. The post copy is created
by a copywriter, the video script is also created

42
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:17,947
by a copywriter, but the reviewing is done by
a content manager. The video is being edited

43
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:22,692
by a video editor, and the carousels are being
designed, or the thumbnail images for the videos

44
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:30,812
are being designed by a graphic designer. So
each of these are subtasks within the creation

45
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:36,795
of a post. And because different people may
be handling this process in a team, we need

46
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:42,599
the ability to assign these subtasks to different
members on the team. And then if you're working

47
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:48,142
with freelancers or contingency members or consultants,
you also need the ability to track the amount

48
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:52,384
of work that they're putting in, say track the
number of hours or track the number of videos

49
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:57,910
or track the number of copies that they're writing.
maybe even track the time that they're putting

50
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:05,194
in for, so that they can bill you at an hourly
rate. Now what you see here is ClickUp. ClickUp

51
00:05:05,354 --> 00:05:12,017
is a task management platform. It is one of
the most customizable and robust task management

52
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:19,201
platforms in the world today. And the interesting
thing about ClickUp is that they bring everything

53
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:24,286
into one platform. So they market themselves
or position themselves as one app to roll them

54
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:32,194
all. So everything from task management to chats
to gun charts and goal setting dashboards to

55
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:42,294
documents and dashboards and whiteboards, everything
is brought into one single platform. And in

56
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:52,722
our case, every single requirement that we have
of a robust content management platform. is

57
00:05:52,822 --> 00:06:00,168
met by ClickUp. So now I am going to jump in
into the Imagine Growth Content Board which

58
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:07,374
is built on ClickUp and walk you through how
it works and how the ClickUp platform works

59
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:16,942
as a whole. So this is the Imagine Growth Content
Platform and it looks a bit confusing but This

60
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:22,283
these are the template cards for each of the
content formats. I'll explain what they are.

61
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:29,645
But these are the template cards for each of
the content formats that we coach you on in

62
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:37,087
the program. Now in the template code you can
see tasks statuses. Now what do we mean by

63
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:43,989
task statuses? Task statuses are the different
stages in which a content piece moves through

64
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:52,228
the content management process. So task analysis
begins with outlines, which is where the content

65
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:58,091
manager takes an idea that is either suggested
by the copywriter or discussed on the weekly

66
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:03,835
content edition calls with the executive and
the content team and creates an outline for

67
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:11,951
that piece of content and adds it in a template
card. Now after the outline stage, the copywriter

68
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:19,497
works on it in the draft stage, which is why
we mark it as CW and creates a draft for that

69
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:24,620
content piece. Now the drafts, the type of drafts
we differ, if it's an experiential video, it

70
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,905
is just the post copy as well as the script
for the experiential video. If it's an informative

71
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:37,109
course, it is just the post copy. If it is a
carousel, then it's the post copy as well as

72
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:45,344
the... slide deck content with which the designer
is supposed to design it. And then after the

73
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:51,466
draft stage, after the copywriter is done creating
the drafts, for that content format it moves

74
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:57,089
to the content manager approval or revision
stage, which is where the content manager reviews

75
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,931
the content created, the draft created by the
copywriter, either suggests changes and moves

76
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:09,830
it back to the drafts queue or he approves it
and moves it to sensitive approval. But in

77
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,617
some cases there may be the creation of a media
file. Now these media files may be videos,

78
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:21,625
they may be carousels, they may be images and
so on which is why we have an awaiting media

79
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:27,538
file step over here and it's in this stage that
the graphic designer the video editor will

80
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:33,942
edit the videos or design the text or images
and send it for approval to the content manager

81
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:41,426
again. Now after all this is done then it goes
to the executives approval queue and the executive

82
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:50,206
reviews it and if it's good to go he can go
ahead and either directly move into the publishing

83
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:55,450
queue but if there's a video to be recorded
by the executor say an exponential video or

84
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,715
a Q&A video there is a recording step as well
inbuilt into this and the publishing queue

85
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:07,380
is in two stages so it can either be published
on the user profile or it can be published

86
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,005
on the company page we also have an option and
that takes up in here so that we can track

87
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:20,520
the analytics for the published content pieces
right within ClickUp itself. Next, let's take

88
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,754
a look at how template cards work. So each of
these are template cards for different content

89
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:32,187
formats. And What I'm going to do now is I'm
going to make a copy of this template card.

90
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:38,271
Say assume you're creating an exponential video.
This is what the process will look like. The

91
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,553
content manager or the copywriters will first
come in here and they will click on this icon

92
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:49,897
over here. They'll click on duplicate and rename
it according to the topic of the post, the

93
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:55,657
exponential video that they want to create.
So for the sake of this example, let's say

94
00:09:55,717 --> 00:10:03,106
the topic I choose the video to be on is how
I was the lowest paid member on my team. So

95
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,068
I type that out over here.

96
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:27,545
as the title and I uncheck attachments and comments
and comment attachments, remove the assignees

97
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:34,689
and the watches and all I need to do is click
on duplicate task and a new task will be created.

98
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:43,512
In here it could take like a few seconds but
after it is created I will click on the open

99
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:51,511
link after this pop-up comes up. and it will
open up the newly created card. Now this is

100
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:56,595
what the template card structure looks like.
So we have a bunch of guidelines about how

101
00:10:56,615 --> 00:11:01,320
the task is supposed to be used. I'll shortly
read through them. Always work directly the

102
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,084
parent task. Do not add descriptions or comments
inside some tasks. So this is what you see.

103
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:14,379
What you see on the screen here is the parent
task and In the parent task we may have subtasks,

104
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:20,263
for example we have 10 subtasks in this parent
task for experiential videos, so it's a video

105
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:25,587
content format and these are the subtasks. You
are not supposed to update anything in the

106
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:32,112
subtasks, it has also been specified here. Everything
is to be updated in the main parent task. So

107
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:36,215
all the descriptions, post copies, updates,
everything is to be updated from the parent

108
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:43,823
task itself. Just to be clear. The second guideline
is that you always need to read through checklists

109
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:47,785
for each sub-task or status and after you're
done with all the checklists for your sub-task

110
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:53,608
update the status. Now the interesting thing
about the ClickUp templates is that for each

111
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:59,931
stage, say for example, this is a task for the
content manager. So for each of these sub-tasks,

112
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:06,614
we have a dedicated checklist section that details
each and every minute step that is to be taken

113
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:15,446
by the content manager for the sub-task. So
whenever you have a... sub-tasks that is assigned

114
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:21,269
to you all you need is look at the checklist
for that specific section see each of these

115
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:26,831
sub-tasks will have their own dedicated checklist
sections that you can look through to understand

116
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:34,055
the different steps for completing that sub-task
so it's basically like a short standard operating

117
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:39,397
procedure for each content format so that you
don't have to think through about what to do

118
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:45,181
for each content format everything is goes according
to process and you need to coordinate much

119
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:49,926
with each team member for each content format
you just need to follow the process that is

120
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:58,273
being outlined in this template card. Now in
addition to these, each of these subtasks can

121
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:03,257
be assigned to different team members. Say for
example if the outlines, creating the outlines

122
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:08,081
for a piece of cotton is being done by the cotton
manager, then it can be assigned to that cotton

123
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:13,045
manager on the team. If the drafts is being
created by a copywriter on your team, you can

124
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:19,551
assign that to a copywriter on the team and
select them in here. If the executive who reviews

125
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:25,805
the cotton and gives the approvals, So if you
do the content, you can select them and assign

126
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:30,657
that specific sub-task to that theme. In addition
to these, we also have

127
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:41,377
relationships built into each of these subtasks
so that this task will not become due until

128
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:46,359
this task is completed. So considering that
graphs can only be created after outlines have

129
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,062
been created there is a relationship set between
these tasks so that this task will not become

130
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:57,184
due until this task is completed. So all of
the subtasks have relationships, all of them

131
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:58,505
have mapped due dates

132
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:09,490
could take if it's being handled by a team member
who's experienced with the process. We have

133
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:15,592
tag for the individual sub-tasks as well as
tags for the main content formats so that later

134
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:23,503
on you can filter them and search them easily
inside the job. And in the description section

135
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:28,529
of the task, so this is the description, editable
description section of the task, you have a

136
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:34,015
rich text editor that you can use to add rich
text, and at the same time, separate sections

137
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:41,010
for outlines, for the video script, for the
post copy, as well as first comment. thumbnail

138
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:45,816
image captions if a thumbnail image is supposed
to be created for that experiential video the

139
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:52,284
mail drive folder link where all the videos
will be uploaded for that content process the

140
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:59,867
recordings folder link where This videos recording
folder will be uploaded finished video you

141
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:06,455
ordered so that the Team members can easily
access the video after it's done, review it

142
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:11,618
and publish it on LinkedIn, a subtitles file
line, the thumbnail image for the video, and

143
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:16,380
the LinkedIn post URL after it is published.
And you don't need to worry about how to fill

144
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,183
each of these. Again, for each of these steps
from the ideation of the process, so right

145
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:28,386
when the content manager creates an outline,
to publishing and promoting it on the user

146
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:35,028
profile and the company page, every single step
of the process outlined in the checklist section

147
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:42,571
corresponding to each of the sub-tasks. So for
the outline of an experience story video we

148
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:50,950
have a list of steps in the checklist that the
content manager needs to do. If it's a different

149
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,952
content format, then the checklist has been
personalized for that content format. So it's

150
00:15:55,012 --> 00:16:00,194
different. Each template card is different,
follows different process workflows specific

151
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:02,175
to that particular content format.

152
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:11,099
The reason we do this is because one of the
biggest reasons for inefficiencies in a content

153
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:18,998
management process is the amount of coordination
and communication that is required. I've been

154
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:25,508
running an agency for about four years now.
And what I've learned is that even if you're

155
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:31,958
publishing content consistently, and a lot of
the communication and coordination from your

156
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:40,225
team is manual one-on-one. You can still make
content marketing work for you, but you will

157
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:48,211
be wasting a lot of your time. In fact, up to
40% of your team's time involved in creating

158
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:53,195
and publishing and promoting a piece of content
will go just into coordination and communication

159
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:55,077
and making sure everybody's on the same page.

160
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:04,992
a structured content management process that
lists exactly what to do, assigns it to the

161
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:10,913
team members who are supposed to do it, who
are responsible for it, and explains what is

162
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:17,335
to be done to each of them in a single place
so that everyone is on the same page is the

163
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:24,697
best way to manage a content management process.
And that is what the ClickUp content management

164
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:31,619
code does. Now I won't go into detail about
like how the each of these content stages will

165
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:35,401
go in how the content piece will go through
each of these stages. You've gotten a brief

166
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:41,163
overview but I will be explaining these in the
dedicated videos for each of the content formats

167
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:50,067
later on in the module. Now let's take a look
at how to. create or make a copy of this content

168
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:55,610
board for your own usage and then personalize
it for your own usage. So below this video

169
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:00,953
you will find a link to this template content
board. I'd like you to check that and open

170
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:07,416
that link in your browser. So ClickUp will first
ask you to sign up. So I'm going to enter my

171
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:13,880
name in here and the email address and password.
They're going to ask you to enter a complex

172
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,250
password so let me just go ahead and enter the
password and click on the table. So I just

173
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:28,393
did that and I'm clicking on play with ClickUp
and now a form should load asking us to enter

174
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:33,476
a confirmation code that was sent to the email
address. I'm just going to copy that and paste

175
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:39,218
it in there and we are done and now ClickUp
should take us in and here there'll be another

176
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:44,520
form where they'll ask us a bunch of details
about the workspace so you can name this as

177
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,601
whatever your company name is.

178
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,708
the content.

179
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,127
and just click on avatar you can drop like your
logo or something that sort of here I'm just

180
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:05,118
gonna skip it so far and then color theme but
I love red so I'm just gonna go with that how

181
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:08,406
many people will you be working with this is
not really important So you can just mention

182
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:12,368
this I don't know. How do you want to start
using click up? So you can say something like

183
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:19,751
marketing your context. How did you hear about
us? We can say other This is not really important.

184
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:24,033
You can say anything you want Just click on
something or just said to imagine true because

185
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:28,475
we he prefer I refer a lot of people to click
up because I think It's been cast soon. You

186
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:31,777
don't need to invite people at this stage I
will show you how to do this later on so click

187
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:38,460
on I am done You can integrate click up to slack
and a bunch of other apps point you can do

188
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,721
it later on, click on no thanks. Any of these
tools for project management that's up to you,

189
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,842
I'm just going to go ahead and no thanks and
click on play with ClickUp. And that's it and

190
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:53,503
ClickUp is going to load and set up a workspace
for us. So I'm going to, you can watch the

191
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:57,544
video if you'd like, I'm going to skip it for
now. I suggest you walk in so that you get

192
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:07,524
familiar with the tool and you understand how
to use it. And then... I just opened the link

193
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:11,948
which you can find in the description below
which is the link to the template board. So

194
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:18,234
just open that link in the same browser window
and they will ask you to create your own list,

195
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:22,458
copy that list and use that template. So you
can name it as you like, it's up to you. Select

196
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:28,274
a space or folder, it's up to you, you can select
a space but it's not really needed. and you

197
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:34,618
can click on also save a list copy of this template
to my workspace and share it with all members

198
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:40,442
click on use template and that should be more
than enough i think i need to select this piece

199
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:45,846
over here so i just select this piece and then
click on use template okay we need a unique

200
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:54,075
name as well so let's just see i'm just gonna
call it IGCon For now, you can personalize

201
00:20:54,115 --> 00:21:01,145
it as you like and click on use template. And
now, clitorp will copy the template list and

202
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:07,732
template board and the view and all. template
cards with all the sub tests, tasks, checklists,

203
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:15,699
all the tags, everything is going to be copied
into your list. So what you see here is a view.

204
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,964
So that's the way we view the tasks. So what
you see here is a list view. But what we are

205
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:25,407
interested in is a board view. So the board
view is what we saw earlier, where it looks

206
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:34,082
like this. And of these cards represent a template
card for each post and you need to duplicate

207
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:40,908
this whenever you want to create a new experiential
video or if you want to create say a Q&A video

208
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:48,394
or a slide post you can click on here you can
click on duplicate rename it okay again you

209
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:54,940
need to uncheck attachments and comments and
comment attachments and then you don't need

210
00:21:57,638 --> 00:22:03,540
either and then you can click on duplicate task
and a new task will be created there will be

211
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,682
a small pop-up in this corner if you want to
create it and that is what you can open and

212
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:14,104
edit let me just show it to you quickly so that
you understand again you take a template card

213
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:18,606
so if you want to create a new slide post you
take a template card you click on duplicate

214
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:22,888
and you theme it as you like so in my case it's
how do i um first be released

215
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,971
So, gonna create a carousel on that. So you
uncheck attachments. Every single time you

216
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:42,033
do it, you uncheck attachments. Comments and
comment attachments, as well as assignees and

217
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:48,035
copywatches. We don't need these. So, I mean,
it's okay if you've selected them. It doesn't

218
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:53,136
matter much. But if there's any attachments
that you've made by mistake in the template

219
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:58,922
cards, if you've edited the template cards,
you should never do. the attachments won't

220
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:03,104
get copied, so the task will stay clean. But
once you're done with that, you can just click

221
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:07,707
on duplicate task, and you should wait for a
while ClickerPace is copying the task right

222
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:14,891
now. So this will finish loading in a while,
takes about 10 seconds, it's done, and it will

223
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:21,034
open it up directly, or you can click on this
open, and it will open it up, and then you

224
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:26,998
can start working on the task where the content
manager goes through each step in his... list

225
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:31,500
so it takes a look at the subtask and then the
first thing is create a copy of the template

226
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,482
task and change parent task status to outlines
so he comes in here and he selects the parent

227
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:42,464
task to outlines but i'm not going to discuss
more about the individual steps for the content

228
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:48,207
management process for each content format because
we have separate videos later on in the module

229
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:53,509
for that all right so this is how you create
your own click up template code and start using

230
00:23:53,569 --> 00:24:01,261
it and now Let's talk a bit about how to filter
for specific content formats as needed. So,

231
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:08,507
filtering is good because it allows you to easily
identify content formats. So you can search

232
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:12,750
and filter. There's options for both filtering
and searching in here. So if you want to quickly

233
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:17,673
find the content format for informative posts,
we just need to search that and it will bring

234
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:21,897
it up here. See if you want slide posts, just
type out the first few words and it will come

235
00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:29,422
up here. Q&A videos it will come up here in
this manner. So it's pretty easy to search

236
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:34,666
and you can do this for even for like say content
pieces that have been created in the board.

237
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:41,531
So if you have a lot of content formats already
for different for content that you've already

238
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:46,194
created you can come in here and just search
for whatever the topic of that post was and

239
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:51,994
it should bring it up for you. In my case for
example I've already created a post on how

240
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:56,277
was the least paid member. So all I need to
do, and there's not a lot of tasks on this

241
00:24:56,317 --> 00:25:02,040
board. So it is not very important, but if you
want to do it, I could just create it like

242
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:08,444
this and I would be able to get the template
more easily. So that is how you search for

243
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:16,850
tasks. And now let's take a look at the filtering.
So in here, there is an option to... filter

244
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:23,139
for tasks you can be able to see it find it
here or if you're using the website you'll

245
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:28,967
be the ux is a bit different the filtering option
is in here and you can use it i recommend using

246
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:39,532
the desktop app because it's faster and ease
of access of any platform is very important

247
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:43,856
if you want to actively take action. So the
more easier ClickUp is to access and let's

248
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:49,760
say create, edit, suggest, edit, so review content,
the more you'll end up using it and the more

249
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,003
results you'll be able to generate with the
content management process. So our filtering

250
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:59,743
is a bit different, but it works the same way
on. for the actual filtering process, you click

251
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:05,628
on this and you get filtered by every single
data field inside the ClickUp task, starting

252
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:11,693
from the due dates to the priorities to who
it's assigned to, to when it's created, what

253
00:26:11,713 --> 00:26:16,217
the due dates are, if there's any dependencies,
what the location is. So it's one of the most

254
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:21,981
customizable task management platforms in the
world today. This is why I said that. And if

255
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:31,499
you want to quickly filter for a specific task
that is in a specific status or that specific

256
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:36,740
tag. You can do it over here step by step. So
it's pretty easy to understand if task status

257
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,762
is or is not, and you can select like all the
task status options. If assignee is, you can

258
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:47,583
select like any particular assignee of the team.
So you can filter for like whatever we want.

259
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:55,205
But typically, almost all data fields that are
available in the task, you can filter using

260
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:55,745
them all.

261
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:05,215
Now the next step after this is to of course
add more team members to the template board

262
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:06,617
so that more team members can come in.

263
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:14,519
you can start assigning tasks and launch the
content process. So for that, all you need

264
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:19,121
to do is go over here, click on this three dots
icon over here, that is the list settings.

265
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:24,384
So whatever you've named your content board
as, just click go to over here at the top and

266
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:29,366
click on list settings. And then at the bottom,
you can find sharing and permissions. If you

267
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:35,809
click on sharing and permissions, you will be
able to invite people by name. So I've already

268
00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:41,217
added a lot of, added a lot of team. of people
on my team but in addition to that you can

269
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:48,064
add your team members you can if you already
bulk added them and you can you want to share

270
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:55,892
access to them to the specific list you can
just type their name but if they're not signed

271
00:27:55,932 --> 00:28:08,050
up to clicker yet you just need to their email
address in this manner and send them an email

272
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:13,677
and an email should get sent to them and after
they click on invite they join they should

273
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:16,700
be able to access kick up. So

274
00:28:20,026 --> 00:28:24,391
At the moment, click-up usage is completely
free, so this entire template board can be

275
00:28:24,491 --> 00:28:28,935
used for free. You can take a paint plan if
you want to customize it and if you want to

276
00:28:29,035 --> 00:28:34,661
use it for more task management and so on, but
at the moment, you can add sufficient team

277
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:41,575
members for the entire content management process
completely for free. Now one of the things

278
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:47,343
I want to assure you of is that you do not need
to follow. the exact structure. While the structure

279
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:53,706
or the process flow that we teach in the program
is based on actual work that we've done as

280
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:58,128
an agency over the past four years, you don't
really need to follow the exact process. Now

281
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:03,350
we've seen this process to work really well,
so you can follow this exact same process.

282
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,373
But if you have a better process that you think
will work better for your team structure or

283
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:13,995
for your own use case, say suppose you're not
using a different content manager or a different

284
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:19,937
copywriter. What you can do is you can combine
both these checklists into one. So you can

285
00:29:20,097 --> 00:29:25,878
edit each, all of these elements on the clickup
task. You can edit everything from the tags

286
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:36,341
to the statuses. You can customize the statuses
of the content board by clicking on the status

287
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:42,644
column. So you click on this. Sorry, I can't
talk about this. click on this button of the

288
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:47,988
status and we click on add or edit statuses
and you can update the statuses in here. So

289
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:54,313
statuses are categorized as not started statuses
or templates as a not started status which

290
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:59,618
means we're not using the task or the task is
not activated it's not been assigned it. Active

291
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:04,722
statuses is when we begin the work on that task
and finally done statuses is when we post it

292
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:12,673
to be some content or the sub tasks are complete
and so on. So That is it with statuses. The

293
00:30:12,713 --> 00:30:18,759
statuses can be edited. The descriptions and
the titles can be edited. The different sections

294
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:23,703
and the descriptions can be edited. The subtasks
can be edited. So you can edit each of these

295
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:29,629
subtasks, rename them. You can add different
time estimates for them. You can edit the...

296
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:36,930
different tags added for the sub-tasks. You
can change the due dates. So all of these things

297
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:43,515
can be done within the sub-tasks itself. Or
you can even change the relationships of each

298
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:50,141
of these sub-tasks and edit the names of the
sub-tasks, change the order, delete sub-tasks.

299
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:57,787
We can edit or delete, sub-type this checklist
as well so that you can personalize it if you

300
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:03,891
need, if you'd like, for your own process workflow.
We would recommend that you stick to this process

301
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:08,894
workflow if you work with multiple team members.
Say you have a copywriter and a content manager

302
00:31:09,054 --> 00:31:12,395
or a graphic designer or a video editor. So
there are multiple members of the team and

303
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:18,003
you're not handling the entire content management
process yourself. this workflow should work

304
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:23,766
more than fine. Even if you're handling multiple
responsibilities, say there is a content that

305
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:28,129
the same person is handling both the content
management and the copywriting process, you

306
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:35,033
can assign both the sub-tasks to the same person.
It's completely fine. The only scenario where

307
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:40,617
this entire click-up process is not needed is
if you're handling the entire process on your

308
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:46,456
own. Say you're handling the entire ideation
creation process on your own and you're only

309
00:31:46,496 --> 00:31:51,538
having an executive assistant or a virtual assistant
on your team publishing the content. So in

310
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,180
such a scenario, a content management board
like this is not needed. You can simply create

311
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,463
a Google Sheet and add it there. But if you
have like more team members involved in the

312
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:05,365
content creation process itself or the content
approval process itself or the ideation process

313
00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:05,745
itself.

314
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:19,545
This is the best structure that you can flow,
that you can follow for a content management

315
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:22,486
process that is well optimized and efficient.
So there are two types of views in the template

316
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:26,867
board. So one is the board view where you can
see all the content, the entire content management

317
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:32,248
process, all the cards in all the formats, and
the different content management stages they

318
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:39,995
are in, like outlines or graphs or content management.
approval or awaiting media file on EDX approval

319
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:46,676
and so on. And in addition to that, we have
a list for the subtasks. Now while the board

320
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:56,319
is for an overall view of all the content pieces,
the list is for the subtasks that the individual

321
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:57,419
team members have to work on.

322
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:11,481
graphic designing of the video editing tasks
or the approval tasking or the task sub-tasks

323
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:16,964
for posting on the company page or the user
profile and so on. So all the sub-tasks have

324
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:24,829
been listed in the list sub-tasks view and the
main board with all the content pieces, if

325
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:30,512
you'd like to take a look at how many we have
in the approved stage, how many are ready for

326
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:35,271
approval, how many are being edited on. how
many adjusted drafts and the copywriters are

327
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:39,533
working on them and how many are just in outlines
waiting for the content manager to add an outline.

328
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:46,678
So the board is for an overall view of the entire
content management process and the list or

329
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:53,202
the subtasks are for the individual subtasks
that the that the team needs to work on. So

330
00:33:53,282 --> 00:34:00,646
all you need to do is handle the board while
you're working on the the content addition

331
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:04,629
call. So the content managers will come in here,
the copywriters will come in here, and they

332
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:08,632
can make a copy of the individual template cards.
They can duplicate the individual template

333
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:14,716
cards, rename them, and start working on the
tasks, the sub-tasks, interview, adding outlines,

334
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:18,699
creating graphs, and so on. They can go about
their work. But if you'd like to take, if any

335
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,942
of the team members in the content marketing
team needs to take a look at the tasks that

336
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:29,850
they need to work on every day for the content
management process, they can just come to list

337
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:36,053
and in here you can see all the assigned tasks
that are yet as still in assigned stage that

338
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:41,535
the team members need to work on. So if they'd
like to come in here and if you want to see

339
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:47,438
only the tasks that are assigned to you in your
queue in ClickUp, just click on this mean button

340
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:53,020
and it will filter out all the sub tasks that
are assigned to other team members. So for

341
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:58,699
example, these are all the tasks that are assigned
to me. So I do a lot of different kinds of

342
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,662
work, which is why you see different kinds of
tasks in here. Say for example, posting, client

343
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:09,687
review, writing outlines or video editing. But
if a video editor comes in here, they will

344
00:35:09,747 --> 00:35:13,069
only see video editing tasks. If a copywriter
or content manager comes in here, they will

345
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:17,633
only see the content tasks or the copywriting
tasks or the content review tasks. If you're

346
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:22,416
the executive, when you come in here, you will
only see the client tasks or the review tasks

347
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:29,613
that you need to focus on. So It is segregated
easily so that you can quickly work, you can

348
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:37,259
quickly take a look at the tasks, the sub tasks
that you need to work on. So the copy, if you're

349
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:43,524
a copywriter, you'll only see the posts that
you have to create, the copies that you have

350
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:49,088
to generate. If you're a video editor, you'll
only see the links to the actual videos that

351
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:53,848
you need to edit and so on. Now one thing to
note over here which is very, very important

352
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:59,393
and I want you to internalize this a gift in
your mind is do not work on the sub task. If

353
00:35:59,413 --> 00:36:03,716
you come in here and we click on this it will
open the sub task. But in here we've dropped

354
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:07,880
something in here. Do not update anything in
the sub task. Always work on parent task. So

355
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,004
if you go up you'll see the button to the main
parent task in here. But even in the list in

356
00:36:13,024 --> 00:36:17,868
the sub task list that you see over here you
have an option to click go directly to the

357
00:36:17,888 --> 00:36:21,874
parent task. So always whenever you come in
here. irrespective of what role you're working

358
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:26,915
in, just don't work on the subtasks in here.
Click on this main parent task link instead,

359
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:31,196
which will open up a parent task. You can see
the subtasks that are assigned to you in here

360
00:36:31,497 --> 00:36:38,939
and you can start working on them as opposed
to working on the individual subtasks. So we

361
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:44,140
do not work on subtasks in this because all
the details of all the post copies, all the

362
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:51,882
work, the links, everything is added inside
the parent task. So please keep that in mind.

363
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:57,003
When you come in here, do not click on this
link, click on this main link of the parent

364
00:36:57,043 --> 00:37:07,366
task. So this link. All right. Now, while the
subtasks are for an overview of the task that

365
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:12,027
you need to work on, and you can filter for
your own task by clicking on this me button

366
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:17,509
over here. The board view is an overall view
for the content-addition calls. So when you're

367
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:23,971
working on the content-addition calls, and you
want to note down a bunch of ideas from the

368
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:28,593
ideas discussed by the executive or by other
team members on the content-edition calls or

369
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:34,195
after the content-edition calls, you can come
in here, you can make a copy of this template

370
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:40,978
card and include the outline or the ideas in
there. Even if you are a copywriter and you

371
00:37:40,998 --> 00:37:45,460
want to suggest a few ideas that are to be discussed
on the content-edition calls before the content-edition

372
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:52,448
call, you can come in here and make a copy of
the template card. and add them in here. Now

373
00:37:52,488 --> 00:38:01,114
that sums up how you can use the different views
in ClickUp, both for content, the overall content

374
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:05,857
management, as well as the individual sub-tasks
that you should be working on every day. So

375
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:10,120
this is the main list that you should be working
on every day to see the tasks that are assigned

376
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,463
to you, the individual sub-tasks that are assigned
to you, so that you can continue with the work

377
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:20,223
and progress each content piece to the next
content next stage in the content marketing

378
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:27,409
process. And the content board is only for creating
templates and getting an overall view of where

379
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:34,355
we are in the content management process for
each content piece. So you can quickly get

380
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:38,178
an overview of like each content piece in here.
There will be different stages in the content

381
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:42,882
management process and that can be seen on the
board. So you have two modes. You have two

382
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:48,491
views. One is board and the other is a list
called subtasks. where you can see the subtasks

383
00:38:48,511 --> 00:38:55,136
that are assigned to you. Next, let's go over
a few rules that you have to follow when you're

384
00:38:55,156 --> 00:39:02,782
working in ClickUp and using the template boards.
So the first rule is that the correct views

385
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:09,368
that you need. So these views have settings.
So all of them have been configured in the

386
00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:13,151
template board already for you. So all you need
to do is just take a look at the board view

387
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:19,296
and the list view. And all the filters are set.
in here so we only have one filter and the

388
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:24,699
one filter in the list subtasks list view is
that you can only see the assigned subtask

389
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:32,124
so this status has been selected and that is
the only type of type of task that you can

390
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:38,208
see in here so you can see only the subtask
with the assigned status in this board and

391
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:42,932
in addition to that we've also set a setting
for the subtasks so that subtasks are all shown

392
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:47,074
as separate tasks as part of like the original
parent task. So these settings have already

393
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:51,296
been configured for you. You don't need to make
any changes. But whenever you make an additional

394
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:57,258
filter, say for example, I'm adding an additional
filter for QDate, all right? So I want to see

395
00:39:57,278 --> 00:40:02,080
the task that I do today. ClickUp will ask you
to save it. You see this prompt called, you

396
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,302
change the layout, save or reload. And this
view has unsaved changes. Do not save on this.

397
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:12,204
So if you add any additional filters and you
want to go back to the original thing, you

398
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:18,140
just need to reload your view. reload clickup
so if I reload clickup like this I just reloaded

399
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:25,406
it by entering command R or control R and it
will automatically revert to the old view so

400
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:31,491
that nothing is changed do not save the additional
views that you want because it could mess up

401
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:37,877
the filtering and the settings and that we've
already saved in the clickup view for you okay

402
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:44,102
so this is the best view you can personalize
this view for your own use case but until you've

403
00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:47,463
tested it out properly and you're made should
you sure that this is the view that you need

404
00:40:47,883 --> 00:40:53,125
do not update the view because the view will
be updated for all the team members who are

405
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:59,988
using this specific list. So the views that
you want are already configured. If you make

406
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:04,530
any additional filtering say for example if
I entered filtering in this board as well,

407
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,932
ClickUp will ask me if I want to save this.
Then go ahead and save it. If you change the

408
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:10,232
view it will get updated for

409
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,573
If you want filtering, you can just use it as
you like. You can filter and use it as you

410
00:41:18,613 --> 00:41:22,696
like, but do not save it. When you save it,
it will get updated for all the team members.

411
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:31,542
All right. So that was the first rule. The second
rule is that subtasks and parent tasks have

412
00:41:31,582 --> 00:41:37,446
different types of statuses. So let me explain
that for a moment. So subtasks, for example,

413
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:45,275
will have two task statuses. So the first task
status for subtasks will be assigned and this

414
00:41:45,355 --> 00:41:51,339
other task status for subtasks will be completed.
So there is only two task statuses for subtasks,

415
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:56,201
assigned and completed. So if something is assigned
to you, you just need to work on it and market

416
00:41:56,221 --> 00:42:02,645
is complete. That is it, very simple. But parent
tasks will have different statuses. So a content

417
00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:08,848
piece on LinkedIn can go from outlines to drafts
to CM approval revisions to a waiting media

418
00:42:08,868 --> 00:42:13,986
file to DDEX approval to a waiting recording.
to need to be ready to be posted to user profile,

419
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:18,668
ready to be posted to company page. And we have
an extra analytics step if you'd like to track

420
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:24,849
analytics, but this is not included in your
existing process. But these from outlines to

421
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:31,831
ready to be posted on company page are the task
statuses for the parent task. To make sure

422
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:35,592
that you don't get confused by this, everything
has been mentioned in here. So like whenever

423
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:40,838
you need to update the status after you're done
with a specific sub task. What status updates

424
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:45,640
like what you need to change it to and how you
need to change it are all mentioned in here

425
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,963
So that you don't get confused and this is different
for each content format So you have like personalized

426
00:42:52,383 --> 00:42:58,325
step-by-step checklist for each Content format
created for you in the template cards so that

427
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:02,647
you don't get confused But this is just so that
you understand that this is the structure that

428
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:07,949
is to be followed Or the process that is to
be followed for parent tasks and sub tasks.

429
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:14,051
So just recapping The subtasks which are included
in the main parent tasks, so these are all

430
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:19,832
subtasks, will have only two task statuses.
One will be assigned and the other one is completed.

431
00:43:20,312 --> 00:43:27,634
So at the start when the cotton manager or the
CM creates the cotton piece from the template

432
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:34,176
card and he'll assign, he or she will assign
all the individual subtasks to all the team

433
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:39,830
members who were involved in the creation of
that cotton piece. And When the team members

434
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:44,753
work on them, they'll have it in assigned status
and all they need to do is mark it as complete

435
00:43:44,793 --> 00:43:49,595
after they're done. So sub-tasks will have only
two task statuses. One is assigned when it's

436
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:54,538
assigned to them and one is completed when they've
completed working on their task. But parent

437
00:43:54,558 --> 00:44:01,442
task statuses, the parent tasks will have multiple
statuses. So it will start from outlines to

438
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:06,365
graphs to scene approval to awaiting media file
to media approval, awaiting recording based

439
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:14,056
on like what stage that content is in and finally
in ready to be posted company page which will

440
00:44:14,076 --> 00:44:19,378
be the last status and after the post is published
and all the work has been done for that post

441
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:28,743
they can mark it as posted. So posted is the
final done or completed status for the main

442
00:44:28,803 --> 00:44:34,965
parent task. Now the reason we specify is this
because when you select the task status is

443
00:44:35,045 --> 00:44:42,324
in here there is an option to like say add this
as outlines or drafts. So do not mark the subtask

444
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:47,686
statuses as anything other than assigned or
completed. So whenever you work on a content

445
00:44:47,706 --> 00:44:53,408
piece the subtask should only have assigned
or completed statuses. Do not update them as

446
00:44:53,448 --> 00:45:01,828
any of these any of these main parent task statuses.
So make sure you follow this process exactly

447
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:09,236
to avoid confusions in the team. So that was
the ClickUp Cottonboard. And now let's talk

448
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:15,342
about some final updates. The templates will
be updated from time to time. So over the course

449
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:22,408
of your program, as you're taking the IG program,
the templates will be updated by us. We could

450
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:27,292
add update existing templates or we could be
adding new templates for new cotton formats

451
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:32,737
that are performing very well on LinkedIn. But
all of these updates will be announced in the

452
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:40,756
group watching calls. or in the WhatsApp communities.
So make sure that you are paying attention

453
00:45:40,796 --> 00:45:46,199
to any of these announcements that we make in
the WhatsApp community or via email or in the

454
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:52,001
group coaching calls. We typically announce
these updates everywhere so that you can come

455
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:57,003
in here and add the new template cards for new
content formats or update the existing template

456
00:45:57,043 --> 00:46:02,318
cards. Now let's take a look at how you can
replace your existing template card. All you

457
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:07,422
need to do is take a look at the link below
this video. So below this video, there'll always

458
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:14,428
be a link of the template board. All you need
to do is create a new copy. It's just like

459
00:46:14,468 --> 00:46:21,674
how I created this board from a template board
from the link below the video. Create a new

460
00:46:21,994 --> 00:46:29,020
board and just copy this to the list, the new
list, the new template board that you created.

461
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:35,935
So let me show you how to do that. So after
you create a copy of the template board, whenever

462
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:41,776
we announce any updates, just make a new copy
in here. And this is, for example, the template

463
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:47,818
board with all the content formats, all the
updated content formats is the most updated

464
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:53,039
version of it. So if the announcement is that
I've added two new content formats, we've added

465
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:58,841
two new content formats, say, viral text posts
and viral tweets, for example, all you need

466
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:04,095
to do is duplicate this into your existing content.
So assume this is your existing content board

467
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:11,077
with all the content formats that you're using
right now with all the additional tasks if

468
00:47:11,097 --> 00:47:14,379
you've already started your content management
process. So there could be additional tasks

469
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:19,541
in here but the templates are in this column
with the content formats that you're using

470
00:47:19,581 --> 00:47:25,523
right now and we announce two new content formats.
Say assume the two new content formats are

471
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:33,856
viral tweets and viral text posts and you need
to start using these. All you need to do is

472
00:47:33,996 --> 00:47:41,162
come in here, click on this button of more options,
click on duplicate and copy the content formats

473
00:47:41,843 --> 00:47:46,266
to the content board that you're using right
now. So in our case it's the IG content board

474
00:47:46,286 --> 00:47:49,890
that is the content board that we're using right
now. So I just click on this and I click on

475
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:59,077
duplicate task and that is it. So this is how
you copy new content formats that we announced.

476
00:48:00,038 --> 00:48:06,641
in the program to your content board. So just
click on more options and click on duplicate

477
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:11,764
and select the content board that you want to
copy to, just click on duplicate and that's

478
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:21,369
it. Now, what do you do if you want to update
a template? So if you want to update a template,

479
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:27,292
so assume we've announced an update for the
experiential videos process, or we've announced

480
00:48:27,312 --> 00:48:32,648
an update for the news text post process. something
like that all you need to do is come to your

481
00:48:32,688 --> 00:48:40,134
content board and find the content piece that
you need to update okay so even if you mess

482
00:48:40,174 --> 00:48:44,117
up like a template and you want to revert to
the original template so you messed up some

483
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:48,701
checklist and you want to revert to the original
template from the program all you need to do

484
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:53,204
is come to the content board that you're using
so this is the content board that we are using

485
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,167
and delete that template card so just delete
the

486
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:05,239
template card and then I come to this template
which is the template that I just copied. Again

487
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:10,280
you can find the link to the original template
board that we are sharing below the video as

488
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:16,642
well as in the progress tracking sheet. But
go to that template and then all you need to

489
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:24,004
do is duplicate this from the template board
to your own content management board. So I

490
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:28,165
just deleted the template card, the outdated
template card or the wrong template card, the

491
00:49:28,205 --> 00:49:33,888
messed up template card. from my content board
and I just come to the content board template

492
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:43,194
that I found from the link below the video and
I just copied that to my own content board

493
00:49:43,634 --> 00:49:56,137
and now it will come in here as in the. templates
list as a new template task. So it'll take

494
00:49:56,157 --> 00:50:01,021
some time to duplicate and copy, but once it's
done, it'll come into this list. So this is

495
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:08,446
how you get updates, get updated template cards
or get new template cards from the content

496
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:17,652
board that we're sharing with you. So assume
that we will constantly be updating new content

497
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:22,810
formats. We'll be introducing new content formats.
If there is any change, significant change

498
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:27,972
in the process that will save a lot of your
time, we will be including, we'll be updating

499
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:32,593
the existing templates, but all of these updates
of new content formats and updates in existing,

500
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:40,256
in the existing process or the existing templates
will be announced to you in via email, via

501
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,457
the WhatsApp community, as well as in the group

502
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:56,288
Keep an eye out for it. Now before we close
off this lesson, what I want to assure you

503
00:50:56,408 --> 00:51:01,610
is that this same content management board can
be used for additional content formats. So

504
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:07,812
you want to create a content format for a blog
post, all you need to do is look at the most

505
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:13,515
similar content formats. Say for example for
blog post, I would say that experience story,

506
00:51:13,555 --> 00:51:19,037
the process that we use for experience stories
would be more or less the same one, the content

507
00:51:19,157 --> 00:51:25,639
process for it. when we create an outline for
a blog post, and then a draft is created by

508
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:29,320
a copywriter or a content writer, and then the
content manager reviews it and approves it.

509
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,481
And then finally, the executive approves it,
and then goes to a ready-to-be-posted queue.

510
00:51:33,781 --> 00:51:38,742
But the ready-to-be-posted queue is not for
LinkedIn, but it's for the website. But if

511
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:46,644
you create a copy, if you duplicate this, you
can create a new template for content formats

512
00:51:46,664 --> 00:51:51,130
that you want to introduce into the process,
say, blog posts or white papers. or any other

513
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:56,152
content format that you can think of because
of the ability of the structuring process for

514
00:51:56,212 --> 00:52:00,514
sub-tasks to different team members in the team,
say content managers or copywriters or executives,

515
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:05,856
or video editors and graphic designers. This
structure that we teach you in the program

516
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:11,258
can be used for additional content formats that
you want to create yourself. So what we're

517
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:16,381
teaching you here is, in addition to like offering
these templates for content formats, we train

518
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:21,856
you and coach you in the program. The structure
and framework can be used for additional content

519
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:28,962
formats that you want to come up with for your
own business or for your own brand. And these

520
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:35,028
can be white papers, these can be blog posts,
this can be ad copies, this can be a new video

521
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:40,292
series or a new interview video series that
you want to introduce. So try to internalize

522
00:52:40,312 --> 00:52:46,237
the framework that we're teaching over here
and try to use it for your own content formats.

523
00:52:46,778 --> 00:52:52,504
Ideally, you should be using the same system
for all of your content, because if everything

524
00:52:52,524 --> 00:52:55,708
is in one place, it'll be far more easier for
you to track. And...

525
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:06,095
To make your content management process efficient,
you need to have it in a single place with

526
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:14,582
multiple team members collaborating in a single
board with a list of sub tasks for each stages

527
00:53:14,622 --> 00:53:18,726
of the content management process assigned individually
to each of the team members, and they can see

528
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:26,432
it in a single view in the lists view in the
content management board. So with that, I'm

529
00:53:26,472 --> 00:53:30,696
signing off from this video. I'll see you in
the next video. If you have any questions at

530
00:53:30,736 --> 00:53:35,660
all about the content management process, ask
them in the group coaching calls and drop them

531
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,263
in the WhatsApp communities so that we can answer
them for you. See you in the next video.
