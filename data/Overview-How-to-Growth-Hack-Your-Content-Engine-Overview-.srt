00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:10,898
content and overall LinkedIn strategy. This
module will not just help you to take your

3
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:15,963
content marketing to the next level, but it
will also help you improve a lot of the existing

00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:20,587
processes in your content marketing strategy
so that they are more efficient and resource

5
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:27,272
driven. We will first deep dive into LinkedIn
content promotion and how it can be done with

6
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:31,795
content engagement pods. And we'll discuss both
manual pods and automated pods and how you

7
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:36,797
can use them to generate quick engagement for
your content on demand and how quick engagement

00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:41,199
will help you promote your content and generate
way more reach than you're getting right now.

00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:46,281
Then we'll discuss the LinkedIn SSI score, the
social selling index score and its importance

10
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:50,923
and its impact on all your LinkedIn efforts,
especially your content marketing efforts,

11
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:56,045
and then discuss the different components of
the SSI score and how you can increase it using

12
00:00:56,145 --> 00:01:02,252
specific actions and steps. We then deep dive
into how you can create a reporting system,

13
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:06,656
which is one of the most important lessons in
this module because documenting the results

14
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:12,180
of everything you do in one place so that we
can see what is working and what isn't periodically,

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,165
ideally on a weekly basis and forming inferences
and learning from that is essential to understand

16
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:24,049
what's working and what's not working, but not
just in content marketing, but your entire

17
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:29,460
LinkedIn marketing strategy. This module will
take around 2 hours to fully watch and learn,

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,064
but most of the tasks we discussed in this module
are recurring tasks that you need to do on

19
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:38,828
a periodic basis, so that will be taking around
2 hours every week to complete. And the core

20
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:44,572
goal of this module is to fast track your growth
on LinkedIn and set you on a good future path.

00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:47,735
