1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,751
So in this video, we're gonna be talking all
about experiential stories and experiential

2
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:12,214
videos and how to create them. Now, this is
one of my favorite content formats because

3
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:16,296
I built an entire business on the basis of experiential
stories, simple text experiential stories.

4
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:21,878
And experiential stories are simply experiential
text stories in the media format. That's the

5
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:25,940
only difference between them. So these videos
will move in a structured format. I'll first

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,719
give you an overview of the task template. and
how the task template works for each of these

7
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,482
content formats. And then I will move on to
how the ideation process works for the specific

8
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:41,486
content format and how we can find content ideas
and use existing content ideas and so on. And

9
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:46,889
then I will move on to how to create the content
formats using Outlines and a bunch of other

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,913
tools that we'll help you with. All right, so
let's first talk about the ClickUp content

11
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:57,249
task. So, the template board. So in the template
board, you can find like the template task

12
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,992
in here. So this is the Experiential Story template.
So once you open this, there are different

13
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:05,116
sections in here. What I'll walk you through
are the different sections for this specific

14
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:11,422
content format. So Experiencer Stories follow
a very linear, very simple process. A content

15
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:17,787
manager creates an outline and then it is assigned
to a copywriter. The copywriter creates a draft

16
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:22,379
and sends it to the content manager for approval.
And then the next subtask is the executive

17
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:26,982
will review the experience of the story. And
then once the executive reviews it, it will

18
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:30,484
move to the next stage, which is ready to be
posted to you when it gets published on LinkedIn

19
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:34,687
on the user profile and then the company page.
In case the executive has any suggestions for

20
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:38,950
feedback, these can be discussed on the content
editing calls and the content manager will

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,453
assign it back to the draft stage. And this
entire process will continue until it is ready

22
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:50,798
to be posted. Now, for each of these template
cards, for each of the individual steps, of

23
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:56,099
these subtasks, we've outlined the entire process
for you and each of these steps are personalized

24
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,801
for that specific content format so that you
don't have to guess and be confused around

25
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:06,262
like how to go about doing this. So at the start,
whenever a content manager is assigning an

26
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:11,884
outline, what they will do here is they will
assign a specific outline to this. So these

27
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:16,645
outlines can either be fetched by the copywriter
or by the content manager from the content

28
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:22,304
ideation sheet. is the content ideation sheet
that I want to work you through. So, this is

29
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:27,226
an example of a content ideation sheet and this
is an example of a content idea. So, what the,

30
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:32,669
if the content manager is assigning the post
to the writer, all the content manager needs

31
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:37,972
to do is copy paste this entire text, come into
the outline section, just paste it. That's

32
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:45,136
it. We have the entire outline in here on the
different stages of that process and the different

33
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:53,171
elements in that idea. the copywriter can go
ahead and create the post. But if the copywriter

34
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:59,573
is creating it, he can either copy this in the
exact same way and add it to the outline, get

35
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:04,054
it approved by the content manager or by the
executive on the content edition calls. And

36
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:08,775
once it's approved, he can go ahead and start
creating the post copy. But the first step

37
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:13,997
is adding the outline. So once the outline is
added, the content manager will begin. So the

38
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:19,178
first step is creating a copy of the template
task. which we have not done. So let's first

39
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,539
create the copy of the template task. So we
create a copy of the template task by duplicating

40
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:28,661
it. So we click on this and we duplicate and
we can remove attachments, comments and comment

41
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:32,962
attachments. So these are not needed. And we
can also remove post watches and assignees.

42
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:38,704
And then we add the name of the post that we're
going to create. So if the post is going to

43
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:44,685
be on this specific topic, this is about made
a short-term sacrifice for a big game. So,

44
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:50,017
but yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna add that made a
short-term sacrifice for a pinkie. And then

45
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:54,582
I'm gonna come in here and click on duplicate
task and this task will be duplicated. Now

46
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:59,046
click on this copying the task, it'll take like
a few seconds. But once the task is duplicated,

47
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:04,971
it'll open up and you can start working on that
specific template task. So that is this first

48
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:13,266
step. So once that is done, the post can be
edited. So I'm gonna wait till that. task is

49
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,668
created. So it will come at the bottom in the
templates queue itself. So now you need to

50
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:22,890
open that task and then first go through each
of these stages. Alright. So the first step

51
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:29,072
is create a copy of the template task and assign
parent task to outlines. So now change parent

52
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:34,615
task to outline. So now what needs to be done
is we need to move this to outlines. Alright.

53
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:39,077
And then the post topic in the task title is
to be added. So this is the post topic for

54
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:42,979
the time being, we can change it later on if
needed. and the outline of the description.

55
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:49,683
So this is the outline that we copied from the
content ideation board. So I can just copy

56
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:57,709
this and come in here and paste it over there
so that it's there. I can also paste it without

57
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,391
the formatting so that it comes as one single
block of text and then I can segment it better,

58
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:07,515
but it's up to you how do you do it. And then
after you do that, we move on to the next task,

59
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:12,899
which is assign the sub task for draft CW to
a CW who will write the post. So next is assigning

60
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:17,123
all of these two individual roles and the role
names have been mentioned at the end of the

61
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:21,587
subtask. So for example, this is for the content
manager. So if I'm the content manager, they'll

62
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:25,110
assign it to me. If this is for the copywriter,
so whoever the copywriter is on the team, I'll

63
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,933
assign it to them. This is for again, for the
content manager. So whoever the content manager

64
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,696
is on the team, I'll assign it to them. This
is for the executive. So whoever the executive

65
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:36,840
is, I'll assign it to them. I'm just doing this
for example sake. So I'm not assigning to other

66
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,168
team members, but. After you add more team members
into your board, you will be able to assign

67
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:47,071
this to other team members and just keep doing
this until all the subtasks are assigned. So

68
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:53,376
that is all these steps. And then the next part
of it is moving the parent task to draft status

69
00:05:53,416 --> 00:06:00,080
because now you've assigned the outline, you've
added the outline and you've added the subtasks.

70
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:05,804
But you also need to one more step, you need
to set status of all subtasks as assigned.

71
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:12,224
we just, we can see it as assigned. So we just
mark it as assigned. This one is assigned,

72
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:19,609
this one is assigned, this one as assigned,
this one as assigned, and this one as assigned.

73
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:26,633
So now all of these sub task statuses have been
updated, they turn green. And then we need

74
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:30,695
to move the parent task to draft status. So
that is the next step in the checklist. So

75
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:34,217
we need to move the parent task status, so this
is where you can select the parent task status.

76
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:38,004
You can either just select on this, but if you
click on this, you can see all the statuses

77
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:44,128
and I click it to draft status. So this is done.
Then you need to mark outline CM sub-task status

78
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:50,492
as complete. So I come in here, outline CM sub-task
status as complete. So I move and come in here

79
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:55,135
and mark it as complete. So outlines has been
added and that step is complete. Then one thing

80
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:59,378
to ensure is ensure due dates for each sub-task
are assigned correctly from where the work

81
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:04,634
is assigned to the CW to post-publishing. The
end duration should already be two weeks. is

82
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:10,319
from the due date of this task to the due date
of this task, it should be two weeks difference.

83
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:17,646
So, if this was done yesterday, this should
be around, okay, so this is today is 19th.

84
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,631
So, yesterday was 18th. So, ideally, like the
entire duration should be done, the entire

85
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:27,535
post should be done and published by May 1.
All right, so that is what we mean by this.

86
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:33,222
And you can Based on, let's say, how much time
you think and your available resources, you

87
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:37,624
can quickly update the due dates. So the due
dates are correct. CM approval should be the

88
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:44,946
next day after that. So I can mark it as Tuesday
or Wednesday, and the EX approval can be after

89
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:50,907
that. So I'll mark it as Thursday. So ideally,
the need EX approval should be on the day of

90
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:55,709
the content edition calls whenever you're scheduling
it. And the ready to be posted can be, well,

91
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,154
based on when you want to publish it. So the
ready to be posted queue, can be understood

92
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:04,817
from the content ideation sheet. So when you
go to the content format sheet, you can see

93
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:09,160
the dates in which that content format is supposed
to be published. So ideally market on that

94
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:13,984
specific day. So if this is Monday, I will mark it
on the next available Monday when that is supposed

95
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:20,608
to be published. So when I would publish this
is on the 29th. All right. And the company

96
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:24,311
page, again, it's up to you when you're publishing
it to the company page. Typically we just repurpose

97
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:29,158
the same post onto the company page. But because
this is an experience, the story of the user,

98
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:34,959
I wouldn't publish it on the company page. So
what I would do is delete this. But again,

99
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:38,460
it is mentioned at the latest stage on what
to do about it. For the time being, let's just

100
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,142
proceed as it is. So this completes all the
sub tasks for the outlines stage. And next

101
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:49,764
we move on to drafts. So the copywriters will
also have a step by step information on exactly

102
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:54,045
what to do. So creating the post copies, ensuring
three to four relevant hashtags, rereading

103
00:08:54,085 --> 00:09:02,016
the hook of the posts. adding any required first
comments, adding images or photos of the executive

104
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:05,878
in the respective section in the description.
So we have sections in the description for

105
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:10,820
images, first comments, post URLs after it's
published. So all of these post copies, everything

106
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,541
is there in the description. So all you need
to do is just follow this exactly as it is

107
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:25,302
and the process will be airtight. After the copywriter 
creates all required elements and adds it,

108
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:31,008
all they need to do is come in here and update
their subtask, which is the draft subtask as

109
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:36,010
complete. And then the content manager will
come in and they will follow the steps in the

110
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:42,553
CM approval revisions checklist. So once both
these are done, all they need to do is come

111
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:51,837
in here and mark it as complete and then move
it to the relevant queue as well. So for content...

112
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,131
For this specific content for my needy, it's
approval is the approval process for the executive.

113
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:05,213
And then on the content edition calls, the content
managers can themselves approve it. That is

114
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:10,254
the best scenario, but you can also assign it
to the executive so that the executives come

115
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:16,236
in here, they review the post copy and the image.
And if it's good to go, they can approve it,

116
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:21,057
move it to the next stage, which is the ready
to be posted stage, and they can mark it as,

117
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:27,002
mark that sub task that is assigned to them as
complete. Or the content manager can handle

118
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:32,227
it themselves by getting the executive to review
this on the content ideation calls itself. That

119
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:37,873
is the best way, but this process can also be
followed. All right, and then the executive

120
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:41,897
assistants come in here, the EAs come in here
and they follow these exact steps that are

121
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:49,759
outlined in here. So we will talk about and
learn. how to generate comments using ChatGPT

122
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:54,500
and how to promote content using automated bot
tools and manual bot tools later on in the

123
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,722
content marketing modules. Until then, you can
hold off on these promotion steps if you're

124
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:05,564
not familiar with them. But after that, you
can start this process of promoting posts as

125
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:10,338
well. And each of the steps involved in promoting
the posts are also mentioned in here. So you

126
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:14,479
can prepare relevant comments using chart GPT
prompts and then add the generated comments

127
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:18,341
as a comment in the parent task. So you need
to add them as a comment in here. You need

128
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:21,943
to check if all the post elements, so the post
copy, the image or photo, hashtags, et cetera,

129
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:26,525
are in place and publish it on LinkedIn on the
executor's profile. After you publish, you

130
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:30,907
need to add the LinkedIn post URL in the description
section. So we have the post URL section for

131
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:35,809
the description section. Just paste the URL
in here for reference later on. And then...

132
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:42,585
you can promote the post in the pods and periodically
check in over the one hour to respond to all

133
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:47,589
the comments from the pod. So if we use pods,
manual pods or automated pods, you'll get like

134
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:51,531
a lot of other users coming in and commenting
on your posts. So you need to reply to them,

135
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:55,834
which is very important, which is why we have
this step. And then finally, after you're done

136
00:11:55,874 --> 00:12:02,219
with all these, all you need to do is mark the
ready to be posted subtasks complete. So that

137
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:07,762
is this subtask that has been assigned to you,
mark it as complete. And then finally, after

138
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:13,467
you're done with that, you can move on to the
next sub checklist, which is if ready to be

139
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:18,431
posted company, a sub task exists above, move
parent task to ready to be posted company status,

140
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:23,375
else move parent task to posted status. Now
what this means is sometimes the sub task will

141
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:28,339
be absent. The content managers may choose to
delete them if the content managers don't want

142
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,903
this post to be published on the company page
as well. If the post is supposed to be published

143
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:38,251
on the company page as well, this task will
be So based on that, the parent task status

144
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:45,294
will change. So if the post is supposed to be
published on the company page, the content

145
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:50,757
stage after ready to be posted user will be
ready to be posted company. If the company

146
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:57,861
posting step is absent, they can directly move
it to posted, which is the final content status.

147
00:12:58,202 --> 00:13:08,239
And by then that post should be done. All right.
So that is the task. And this is how you go

148
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:17,465
about managing that piece of content. So this
covers the entire process of managing the journey

149
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:23,348
of an experiential story post from ideation
and creation to publishing. Now let's take

150
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:30,713
a look at how to create experiential stories.
So ideation works for experiential stories

151
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:35,114
in two ways. One is from the content ideation
sheet. So the content ideation sheet, which

152
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:41,676
can be found inside the content analysis sheet,
will have a lot of ideas that the executives

153
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:48,738
have written down. But these ideas may also
come from the content ideation calls so that

154
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:53,499
you can discuss new ideas. All you need to do
is take a look at the anecdotal story section.

155
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,481
So this is the section that is most apt for
experiential story content ideation. So on the

156
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:03,102
content ideation calls, you can ask the executives
questions about, What is a major life change that

157
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:07,583
you've had? Like moving to a new city, quitting
a job or starting a new business. So they will

158
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:11,324
recall an experience about a major life change
and they will talk about it. And then you can

159
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:15,125
prompt them with questions. You can ask them,
okay, first can you give me a short and quick

160
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:19,366
summary? After they answer that, they can say,
can you give me some background information

161
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:24,028
and a two to three sentence elaboration? Or
what was the moment of highest drama when you

162
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:28,649
made this major life change? Or how did this
major life change make you feel? How did this

163
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:33,875
major life change make others around you feel?
What did this major life change make you realize?

164
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:39,379
What is the lesson you learned from this? So
ideally you need to note this down. You're

165
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,602
making sure you're recording the content ideation
calls, but you also need to note this down

166
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:49,647
in the content ideation sheet when you're working
on that content idea. So over time, the content

167
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:55,051
ideation sheet will become a living, breathing,
robust document with a lot of experiences and

168
00:14:55,531 --> 00:15:02,642
opinions and ideas from the executive. You can
use it later on in a much quicker fashion,

169
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:06,704
in much more efficient fashion if you have a
lot of content ideas in here. But for that

170
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:11,905
to happen, you have to ask these questions,
ask questions about each of these prompts to

171
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:17,387
the executive and note them down in the content
ideation sheet when you're working on that post.

172
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:22,208
Right before you start working on that post,
make sure you get the transcript from the content

173
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:29,102
ideation call. You add the idea in here for each
of these columns. So don't just add everything

174
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:33,464
in one column. That is not a structured way
to do it. Add it in a structured fashion in

175
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:42,048
all these columns. And then copy paste that
idea into the outlines section in the template

176
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:49,150
card, in the card, and then start working on
the post copy. All right, so that is how ideation

177
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:54,613
works. So the ideas can come from existing ideas
in the content ideation sheet, or it can come

178
00:15:54,653 --> 00:16:01,149
from new ideas that you discussed on the content
ideation call, but the new ideas also need to

179
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:06,292
be documented in the sheet. So you can edit
this as you like. So if you want to add like

180
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:11,756
one more example or idea about a short-term
sacrifice or big gain, you can just copy paste

181
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:18,101
this exact same row down below and you can edit
that idea and create like a new idea for the

182
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:23,064
same prompt. So you can create like multiple
ideas for the same prompt. So for example,

183
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:29,100
learned from a big loss. There are multiple
losses in the life stories of entrepreneurs

184
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,903
and founders and powerful people and rich people.
So you can talk about, you can add multiple

185
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:40,846
ideas for each of these lines, but you need
to make sure that you're asking these questions

186
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:46,629
and prompting them with more deeper, deeper
questions with each of these prompts and columns

187
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:52,372
had as mentioned over here. All right, the only
way to create good experiential stories is by

188
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:57,656
getting really deep into that experience. and
really getting details about that experience.

189
00:16:57,696 --> 00:17:01,919
You cannot just talk about, okay, I made a short-term
sacrifice where I begin, this is what I learned,

190
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,362
this is what the experience was. You need to
give them the details. So you need to give

191
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:10,066
them, I was struggling with cashflow, we began
like say with LinkedIn, these are all details.

192
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:15,731
So this is an example of good detail in an experiential
story, and these details will enable you to

193
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:21,536
create good content. So unless you're asking
these questions, these questions for each of

194
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:27,141
these prompts to the executive, it is very difficult
to get these details. You cannot research all

195
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:32,005
of these details yourself. So, you need to be
asking these questions. Now that sums up the

196
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:40,213
ideation part for Experiential Stories and Experiential
Videos. Let me go back to the content template

197
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:45,978
board and also walk you through how the process
will differ for Experiential Videos. So, Experiential

198
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:50,814
Stories are simple text posts, but when it comes
to Experiential Videos, The process is a bit

199
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:56,016
different because now you need to create a video
script as well. The executive needs to record

200
00:17:56,036 --> 00:18:00,558
the video, thumbnail images need to be created,
the videos need to be edited. So there's a

201
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:06,501
few more elements in the process. So let's walk
through that step by step. So the content process

202
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:10,263
and the subtasks in this is a bit different.
So first the content manager creates the outline

203
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,205
as usual. Then when the copywriter creates the
drafts, there is a small change. So the copywriter.

204
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:22,558
will now also create a video script for the
experiential video. So based on it's very similar

205
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:27,322
to the experiential story, but this will be a
video script as opposed to a text copy. Okay.

206
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:31,506
And they will create a different post copy than
the video script. So the video script and the

207
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:37,070
post copy shouldn't be the same. It should be
different. It should be unique. And then follow

208
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,434
the remaining, like say parts of the checklists,
the remaining steps in the checklist. And then

209
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:47,070
it goes to the content managers approval queue.
So that is the next sub task after it. So the

210
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,674
content manager will review the script as well
and the thumbnail caption elements. So many

211
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:57,758
videos you can add on LinkedIn, on videos you
can add a thumbnail image as well that is a

212
00:18:57,818 --> 00:19:02,462
bit more click-worthy or gets people to click,
stop scrolling and click on it. So you can

213
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:07,926
add a thumbnail image and the video editors
can create that thumbnail for you. But you

214
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:12,449
need to add a caption for it. So that is this
section called the thumbnail image caption.

215
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:16,728
So the copywriters will add that and then the
content manager will come in. They'll review

216
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:22,010
the post copy, the script as well as the thumbnail
caption and it moves on to the next stage if

217
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,193
it's approved. So the executive will again review
the post copy, thumbnail image, caption and

218
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:31,496
script and only after this will the executive,
it moves to the awaiting recording here. So

219
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:36,859
this is where the executive records the video
themselves using their phone. The smartphone

220
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:40,621
is more than enough, records the audio in a
good fashion so they need to be recording it

221
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:49,663
in a good setup. and checks of these checklists
in this specific subtask and then it moves

222
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:55,468
on to awaiting media file. So, the awaiting
media file is where the video editor works

223
00:19:55,528 --> 00:20:00,733
on it. So, when the content manager is assigning
all the subtasks, they need to be selecting

224
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:06,418
the video editor for this subtask, assigning
this video editor for that subtask. So, the

225
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,740
video editors, this will come to the queue of
the video editors and click up and they can

226
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:15,447
edit the videos. Create the thumbnail images,
make sure the video audio quality is good.

227
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:20,688
Um's and ah's and unwanted gaps in the videos
are all removed. They add some background music

228
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:27,630
in the videos, it will look good. And then they'll
mark the subtasks, they'll move it on to the

229
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:34,432
next stage. They'll mark their subtasks as complete.
And the next stage is awaiting media. Sorry,

230
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:38,553
this is what we completed. The next stage is
CM approval revisions. So that is where...

231
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:44,708
The content manager reviews the finished edited
video and the thumbnail image in the finished

232
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:49,470
video URL section. So it will be linked over
here in the finished video URL section and

233
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,533
all they need to do is review it. If they have
feedback and revisions are needed, they can

234
00:20:54,593 --> 00:21:00,776
send it back to the video editor or they can
send it to executive's approval. So the executive

235
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:04,657
will now look at the edited video. If they have
feedback, they'll send it back to the content

236
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:09,540
manager. or they can approve it and then they
move on to be ready to be posted to you and

237
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,062
ready to be posted for company page queue. So
it's a bit different from the experiential story,

238
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:18,404
but all the other remaining processes for how
the content is supposed to be created is the

239
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:23,727
same. And now let's finally move on to how to
create an experiential story. So now we have

240
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:27,749
some ideas that we can work with, but how do
you go about creating an experiential video

241
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:34,733
or a story? So this is where the IG content,
viral content marketing workbook comes in.

242
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:40,389
The best thing about the book is that for each
of the content formats, we have a separate

243
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:46,735
dedicated section. We can find the link to this
direct section in the progress tracking sheet.

244
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:53,241
Or you can just search for it in the sheet.
So you can just search for experience.

245
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:04,395
So, we click on experiential story, it will take
you to the experiential story section. So, these

246
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:09,859
are details about the experiential story section,
but the section that we want are the outlines.

247
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:15,323
So, in the sidebar, you can see it. These are
experiential story outlines. Now outlines are

248
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:20,447
very similar to the hook outlines that we talked
about earlier in the modules. But outlines

249
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:25,334
are basically viral posts that we've source
from LinkedIn from various creators. And what

250
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:30,136
we've done is we've reverse engineered these
entire outlines for you. So all you need to

251
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:35,278
do is come in here and find among the outlines
that examples, we've added five different examples

252
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:41,361
of experiences story outlines. So you can go
through each of these outlines. And you can

253
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:47,804
choose an outline that is relevant enough for
you. So this one is about company name is Chinese

254
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:54,022
or people criticizing us. Outline three is about.
My real name is Adi Suja, you see this woman I'm

255
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:58,363
in Love with, she is the one who taught me about
love. So this is about my mother. So that's

256
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:04,585
a very emotional thing. It's a very shocking
controversial topic. So made a shocking confession

257
00:23:04,605 --> 00:23:10,747
related to a relationship started. So that is
what this post is about. Fourth outline is

258
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:17,528
about define describe a painful moment, public
moment. So these may not exactly be aligned

259
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:25,475
with the content ideas that you've the most
apt outline that in your opinion on that content

260
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:31,618
idea. So, if you feel that this outline is apt
for this, you can select that outline and you

261
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:36,680
can start working on it. So, just choose the
outline and all you need to do is read the

262
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,842
content idea thoroughly and then come in here
and say, in that entire experience, what is

263
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:46,244
a painful moment that I can describe? You can
add one or two lines or three lines for it,

264
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:53,119
but in that entire experience, what is a painful
moment? public moment that we can detail as

265
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:57,941
a one line over here. And you move on to the
next line. My first reaction was hard to resist.

266
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:02,744
So think about what, let's say, a reaction could
have been or could be. It's not necessary that

267
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:08,647
all the details for all the lines comes from
the content ideas itself. The executives are

268
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:12,830
going to review this anyway. So it's fine that
you add some detail of your own. These can

269
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,212
be corrected later on the ideation calls when
the executive reviews it. But it's important

270
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:18,193
that you

271
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:27,397
look at each of these outline prompts and add
a line for it. Look at the outline prompt,

272
00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:31,739
add a line for it. We won't be getting into
an over the shoulder version of how to do this

273
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:37,202
because content ideas can differ a lot, but
this is how you go about creating outlines.

274
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:42,605
Now even for video scripts, if you're creating
an experiential story, the same exact same

275
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:47,048
outlines will work for you. You don't need different
outlines for the video scripts. The exact same

276
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:52,912
outlines can work for you. But here's where
it gets After the outline is created, after

277
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:58,796
you create the actual post copy of the video
script, you need to create the hooks. So for

278
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:05,121
the hooks, we go back to the hooks section that
we covered earlier. So we have 100 viral hooks

279
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:09,984
over here. So after you create the post from
the outline, then you need to come back to

280
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:15,728
hooks and ensure that the first few lines, the
first one or two or three lines of the post

281
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,811
are optimized. using these hooks. So you can
go through, we have about a hundred hooks.

282
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:25,733
You can definitely find a hook that is valuable
for you, that is good enough for you and find

283
00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:30,115
a good hook and personalize it and add to the
top of the post and make sure that the post

284
00:25:30,215 --> 00:25:37,978
flow is good enough. But this is how you go
about creating experiential stories and videos.
