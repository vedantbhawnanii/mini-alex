1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,210
So in this video, I'm going to walk
you through a structured process to

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,029
analyze and document what we're already
doing with our new content strategy.

3
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:11,749
So before you start executing the
work and filling out the existing

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,670
content analysis sheet, which we use
in this step, make sure you have your

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,570
website, your social media profiles,
and all the sales and marketing for

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,610
collaterals you may have published
online publicly with you so that it is

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,264
easier for you to complete this quickly.

8
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:29,175
If you're not sure where everything
is, just watch the video once for

9
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:32,055
you, and then reach up to your team,
get everything we've talked about in

10
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:33,774
the video, and then start to work.

11
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:38,065
This analysis will take about two
hours in total to complete, fully

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,535
including watching the training.

13
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:41,205
Now let's jump into it.

14
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:45,675
So this is the existing
content analysis sheet.

15
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:51,205
So just like the competitor analysis
sheet, we already have TOFU, MOFU, and

16
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:53,094
BOFU sections that we need to fill out.

17
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:57,855
And all we need to do is take a look
at our existing website and our social

18
00:00:57,855 --> 00:01:01,934
media platforms and the key profiles
and understand what type of content

19
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:05,795
we are already publishing and just
document them here so that we can

20
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:07,695
easily compare them to our competitors.

21
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,135
Now, how do we go about doing this?

22
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,925
So the first thing I would do
is I would go to the website.

23
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:15,654
I would take a look at the blog
if we have a blog and so on.

24
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:18,364
So this must be there in the
header section, the dropdowns of

25
00:01:18,364 --> 00:01:19,924
the header or in the footer links.

26
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:22,034
So we do have a blog, we do have.

27
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,399
Case studies and so on.

28
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,039
So I've opened them up in new
labs and at the same time we

29
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,119
also have social media profiles.

30
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:30,779
So we have LinkedIn, Facebook,
YouTube, and Instagram, and

31
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:31,999
I've opened all of them here.

32
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:36,419
And this is the key
profile that we can find.

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,109
You will know like who the key
profiles are, who are actively

34
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:40,409
creating content on LinkedIn.

35
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:45,309
You can just ask your team if you're not
familiar with who does it, but otherwise.

36
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:49,999
These key profiles would be actively
publishing content on LinkedIn.

37
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,569
Those are the only profiles you should
be analyzing and then the company page

38
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:55,179
with all the posts on the company page.

39
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,329
So just come to the company page,
click on posts and then all and

40
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:00,499
you'll be able to find all of the
posts that they're publishing.

41
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,119
And now what we're going to do is
we are going to go through each

42
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:06,769
of these sections one by one.

43
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:09,879
So TOFU, we have blog posts,
LinkedIn posts and videos and stuff.

44
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,419
So we need to take a look at these.

45
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:13,914
And we need to link them over here.

46
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:17,724
So I'm going to go about
and do that quickly.

47
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,944
So the first thing we need to look at
is awareness focus blog posts, so that

48
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:22,684
short form awareness focus pieces.

49
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:24,614
So let's take a look at blog posts.

50
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:27,944
So we already have the blog in here.

51
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:32,284
So let's just take the blog and in
the blog, we have a bunch of posts.

52
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:36,804
So I'm just going to open these up in
new tabs just to understand what they are

53
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:40,814
about, how in depth they are, et cetera.

54
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,409
I'm going to open all of them.

55
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,309
You don't need to open all of them
always, but it's good to take,

56
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,009
spend some time and take a look.

57
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,869
These only seem to be so many.

58
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:56,029
So yeah, I think we have more so
I can take a look at these just

59
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:58,089
to understand a general view.

60
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,969
If you go through like 20 of the posts,
you should get an understanding of

61
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,259
different types of blog posts they publish

62
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:08,749
and what they're about.

63
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:09,419
So.

64
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:11,264
I'm just going to open them.

65
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,154
I think we have enough.

66
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:15,244
So I'm just going to quickly go
through each of these and try to get an

67
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:17,454
understanding of how these blog posts are.

68
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:18,324
Take a look at this one.

69
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:22,994
So this one is quite short.

70
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:27,514
So I'm going to include
this in this section.

71
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:32,514
I'm going to close it off and
I'm going to include it in here.

72
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:36,384
So I'm just going to enter the
name and we need to hyperlink it.

73
00:03:36,524 --> 00:03:39,494
So I'm going to copy this
URL and close that tab.

74
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:47,004
I'm going to move on and
hyperlink it there, right?

75
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:47,614
That's it.

76
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:52,274
And then we have let's just
move YouTube towards the end.

77
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:56,534
Then we have a digital future
for the infrastructure industry.

78
00:03:56,884 --> 00:04:00,374
So this is more like awareness
focus, again, very short form.

79
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:04,494
There's links to something, just links
to the image and not properly optimized.

80
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:06,554
And there is a demo CD at the end as well.

81
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,409
So I'm just going to go through these.

82
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,009
I'm just going to find some, some ones
that I find that I think are good.

83
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,509
Maximum benefits from
construction project management,

84
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,709
construction management software.

85
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,099
So again, this is like a it's more the
awareness focus and, but it's very short

86
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,869
without a lot of detail in it or images
and illustrations in it construction

87
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,069
industry's next step mobile technology.

88
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,599
So this is good.

89
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,269
This is again an awareness focused piece.

90
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:32,499
I'm going to take this.

91
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,979
I'm just looking for like
different types of content.

92
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:37,269
We've already added a
generic blog post in there.

93
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:40,349
Implications of the
industry, again, very short.

94
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,709
Data visualization and its impact
on construction project management.

95
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:44,979
Okay, that's not bad.

96
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,959
This is a bit more longer,
but still quite shallow.

97
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,379
So maybe this is an
example that I would add.

98
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,329
I close all of these tabs
that I already reviewed.

99
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,739
Go back.

100
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:06,329
The link.

101
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,299
Make sure you always add
the headlines and the links.

102
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:12,534
So that it's easy to understand what
it's about, and you can check the link

103
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,144
if you need more information later on.

104
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:18,874
This one is about five ways in which BIM,
Building Infrastructure Modeling, has

105
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:20,284
transformed the construction industry.

106
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:21,974
Again, this is a good example.

107
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:25,624
It's a shallow piece, but I
think it's bit value adding

108
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:27,044
could be an interesting topic.

109
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,694
So I'm gonna include that in here.

110
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:35,604
I'm gonna get the link, and
I'm gonna paste it in here.

111
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,574
Effective allocation using
contract management system.

112
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:46,934
So I guess this is a
feature that they have.

113
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:49,864
Mobilize and demobilize
full kitting module.

114
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:55,884
I guess this is a module inside
their inside their software.

115
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:00,314
Trace cost full kitting module, yeah.

116
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:03,364
So, that is something
inside their software.

117
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,094
Again, not very interesting.

118
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:06,344
Not like awareness focused.

119
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:09,754
Five ways technology can solve
common construction problems.

120
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,874
Again, this is like an
awareness focused piece.

121
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,889
But I'm going to keep managing the
rest of the construction industry's

122
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,539
digital transformation role.

123
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,599
Why should construction technology be
required for bidding and project planning?

124
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,509
Top 10 construction industry trends.

125
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:30,449
Yeah, trends articles are always
stuff that people commonly use.

126
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:31,529
So I'm going to pick that.

127
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:32,389
I'm going to go here.

128
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,889
I'm going to add that in there.

129
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:35,799
And I'm going to hyperlink it.

130
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,039
All right.

131
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,479
So I'm just going to
close all of these off.

132
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,389
How technology is increasing
productivity in construction industry.

133
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,274
Oh, interesting.

134
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:52,894
They've created a video about this.

135
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:54,394
Let's take a look at the video.

136
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:57,244
So this is more like a
slide video with just music.

137
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:59,294
So they just insert some music in this.

138
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,064
And they've just added the text in there.

139
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,874
So I guess they repurpose it from
the blog post content itself.

140
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:05,944
Drones.

141
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:10,584
Yep, they repurpose it from
the blog post content itself.

142
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:15,664
Okay, maybe it's a bit
more detailed than that.

143
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:21,134
But, they've created a video
out of just music and text.

144
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:22,364
Cool.

145
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:23,224
Okay.

146
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,844
Data brick road to efficiency.

147
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:27,364
Okay.

148
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:35,964
This is a bit more detailed,
but it's still not big enough to

149
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:41,784
show cover like in depth or to
qualify as an in depth article.

150
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:44,414
So this is also just like a slide video.

151
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,624
So I'm not going to look at that.

152
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:49,424
RP in the construction industry.

153
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:52,454
No, not a very disruptive title.

154
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,554
Golden threads that
connect us to the world.

155
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:58,594
Lack of visibility.

156
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,009
Yeah, still not very good enough.

157
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:04,209
Alright, I think we're
about done with TOFU.

158
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:10,799
And one thing I like to do after I
fill this out is, fill out how do I

159
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,729
think this helps your target audience.

160
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,309
So, how do I feel these posts
help our target audience.

161
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:19,289
So, I'm gonna merge all of
these, because I have the same

162
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,509
opinion about all of these.

163
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:21,589
So these are,

164
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:30,509
these are quick reads on various topics.

165
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:44,824
Related to the construction niche, but
not very helpful to our target audience.

166
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:48,464
So don't always need to mention,
like have the opinion that this

167
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:49,664
does help our target audience.

168
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,034
You can also disagree with it.

169
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,534
If they're not helpful, you can
just mention that over here.

170
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:54,294
All right.

171
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:57,394
So I don't think this is a very helpful
content piece for target audience, so

172
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:58,674
I'm just going to mention that over here.

173
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:01,144
Do you wish to creating
this gutted format?

174
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:04,544
Again you can if these are different
content formats, so there's some

175
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,714
like different versions of blog
posts and stuff like that, you can

176
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,914
include them over here, but most
of these are in the same category.

177
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:15,494
So I'm just going to merge all of these
and I'm going to enter a no over here

178
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:19,614
because I don't honestly feel that this
adds a lot of value, this type of content.

179
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:22,384
So I'm going to add a no and I'm
going to move on to the next one.

180
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:25,894
So the next one is LinkedIn posts,
awareness, focus, viral news and trends.

181
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:26,414
All right.

182
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:29,024
So now let's jump to
LinkedIn and let's see like.

183
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,259
What are they doing that
are awareness focused?

184
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:35,169
So this one is about Hub
of Construction Expo.

185
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:38,229
Okay, they attended an event and
this is a post about that one.

186
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:41,529
So this is something that we can include.

187
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,819
This is a company page post.

188
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,299
So this is about, how would I name this?

189
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:53,849
This is something I would
name as event, event news.

190
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,269
All right, and I would
hyperlink that post.

191
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:04,639
Link in here and I'm done and I'm
going to move on to the next one.

192
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,009
How are you managing
your invoices right away?

193
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:12,639
Yeah, it's more of like project financial.

194
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,059
It takes up things for the better.

195
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:15,809
We have some reposts on this.

196
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:16,919
Okay.

197
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:17,949
It's not visible yet.

198
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,539
Dynastrace lost SAP store.

199
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:21,679
Okay.

200
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:26,019
This is like a collaboration
with SAP, a new integration.

201
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,819
So this is like a product feature update.

202
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:30,989
So I'm gonna copy that.

203
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:36,279
The product feature
updates come more in BOFU.

204
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:37,559
And stuff like that.

205
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:41,139
Or in here.

206
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,799
So I'm not gonna get
into that at this stage.

207
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,579
I'm just gonna keep going down
and see what else they do.

208
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,589
Again, this is an events news post.

209
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:51,539
Hmm,

210
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,379
this is like, there are critical injuries.

211
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:09,014
So, what I'm trying to understand
is, are there awareness focus posts.

212
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:12,214
Now, awareness focus posts are not
really about the product or the service

213
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:16,604
or they're not salesy they're not very
in depth, they're just used to generate

214
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:21,284
awareness for the trace cost brand or the
key profile personal brand on LinkedIn.

215
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:21,904
All right.

216
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:24,674
So, I'm just going to go through
the company page posts first.

217
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:27,604
Top 10 global construction
projects in 2023.

218
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:27,814
Okay.

219
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,014
This one is not bad.

220
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,884
Good engagement as well.

221
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:34,234
Mumbai International Airport.

222
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:35,244
Okay.

223
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,044
I like this one.

224
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:42,704
So I'm just going to copy top 10
construction projects in here, and

225
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:51,144
I'm going to hyperlink to that post
by copying the link in here done.

226
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:52,634
So that's good.

227
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:56,214
This is more like product
feature and stuff like that.

228
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:57,614
So,

229
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:03,384
okay.

230
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:07,834
This is like a, it's like a
testimonial compilations like post.

231
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,574
So this is more bottom of
the funnel because we have

232
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:12,984
testimonials in here, I guess.

233
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:14,884
We have testimony videos
and stuff in here.

234
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:20,844
So what I would do is I could copy this
there, but I'm going to keep it like this.

235
00:12:21,114 --> 00:12:22,594
I'm going to get to it only at that stage.

236
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:23,184
All right.

237
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:25,564
So construction projects.

238
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:25,944
Okay.

239
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:29,434
This is like a news post about
Canada's national housing policy.

240
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:31,764
Construction is expensive today.

241
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,874
It's just 2 X blah, blah, blah.

242
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:35,644
They do mention resource in the post.

243
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:38,214
Constituent projects in your TLO
should budgets and timelines.

244
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:39,414
How do we stop this?

245
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,514
Okay, not, not a lot of engagement.

246
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:43,724
KPMG report.

247
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:53,174
Okay, so this is kind of
like a KPMG report summary,

248
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:54,774
something like that, right?

249
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:55,764
So that is a good one.

250
00:12:55,764 --> 00:13:03,114
It's not really about
summary of KPMG, right?

251
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:10,874
I'm going to copy that, copy the link
to the post and that that's done.

252
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:11,434
Yeah.

253
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:15,134
So these, these are the kind of posts that
we mean by TOFU a wireless focus post.

254
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:16,404
So

255
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:19,774
yeah, Spain.

256
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:36,764
Okay.

257
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:39,734
They're adding pictures at
the end of all the posts.

258
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:47,084
Not bad.

259
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,544
They've gotten some engagement as well.

260
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:54,114
Okay.

261
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:56,184
This is more like a
customer experience story.

262
00:13:56,184 --> 00:13:56,794
You see this?

263
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:57,664
Before TraceCast.

264
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:59,794
So they started using
TraceCast and they reduced it.

265
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:02,374
So it's not really TOFU content.

266
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:03,334
I'm going to keep going.

267
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:07,204
You can add it to the sheet at
this stage, like in that section.

268
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:10,854
But I want to go about this in a
structured fashion, because otherwise

269
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:12,544
it could become a bit confusing.

270
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,754
So, there's a trace cost.

271
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:17,784
This is more, not again, TOFU.

272
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:29,724
Canadian economy and construction.

273
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,894
So this is more like an
awareness focus piece.

274
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,644
So I would mention this
as Canadian economy,

275
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:44,944
Just to get like a fair
idea about the topic.

276
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:45,884
All right.

277
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:49,454
Now I need to give, what do you
think about, how do you think I helps

278
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,064
this helps your target audience.

279
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:54,124
So I could enter something
along the lines of this

280
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:10,854
helps keep my audience on LinkedIn
engaged with niche content.

281
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:13,204
Updates.

282
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:15,634
All right.

283
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:16,974
So that's how I think it helps it.

284
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,784
Do you wish to continue
creating this content format?

285
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:22,064
Yes, I do.

286
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,094
Because I do think it helps
with our LinkedIn efforts.

287
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,984
And it generates engagement.

288
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,884
But not a lot of engagement.

289
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:32,004
So I'm not like a huge fan
of this content format.

290
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,654
I think there needs to be
more in depth stuff as well.

291
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:37,274
Most of this content is just TOFU content.

292
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:38,359
All right.

293
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,019
So I'm going to include yes.

294
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:42,039
And now we need to talk about videos.

295
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:45,139
So videos are awareness focused,
LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, etc.

296
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,529
So and we only need to enter four of them.

297
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:55,379
So I've only like done the company
profiles for most of the niches.

298
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:58,739
Most of your niches, most of the
industries that you're targeting.

299
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:02,584
The most of the content will be
published from the company page itself.

300
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:05,024
In case there are key profiles,
you can include content.

301
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:09,704
So in this case it's Prabh who
publishes most of the content.

302
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,314
Prabh has a good following.

303
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:13,294
He's about 16, 000
followers, blah, blah, blah.

304
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:14,714
He's publishing content actively.

305
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:18,934
So he's publishing like say almost
every single day except weekends.

306
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,414
But he does get a bit
of engagement as well.

307
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,304
So he's publishing
different types of content.

308
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:24,534
Carousel.

309
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:28,284
So these are all good
examples of TOFU content.

310
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:31,924
So you could include them over here.

311
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:36,144
If you want to include additional content
pieces, all you need to do is just add

312
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:41,364
a new role below this and just fill
that out with this post, for example.

313
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:46,934
So it's about how in Iraqi British
architect pulled off the impossible.

314
00:16:47,194 --> 00:16:49,334
So this is the kind of like a news post.

315
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:50,144
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:10,099
I'm going to include it as a slide post
or carousel just to add some context.

317
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,269
All right.

318
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,989
So same question that we need to answer.

319
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:15,929
This helps keep my audience
on LinkedIn, engage the niche

320
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,109
content, updates and trends.

321
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,679
And carousels seem to be getting good
engagement as well on his profile.

322
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,369
So I would say it's a
good idea to publish this.

323
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,494
The seven deadliest construction
projects in the world.

324
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,644
These are interesting topics.

325
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:31,204
I would, I would continue publishing
them and do you wish to continue

326
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,224
creating this content format?

327
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:34,374
Of course, I do think the
content is interesting.

328
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,104
The audience, I am seeing engagements.

329
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:40,434
You should be taking a look at the numbers
on your profile or on your company page

330
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:42,194
when you evaluate the TOFU content.

331
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:42,784
All right.

332
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:46,884
And now we are moving back to,
let me just merge these as well.

333
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,964
And now we are moving back
to videos, awareness, focus,

334
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:51,464
LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram rings.

335
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:53,024
So let's take a look
at the other platforms.

336
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:57,109
First we have Facebook we
do have some videos in here.

337
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:01,219
So record progress that
works on a construction site.

338
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:05,959
So these are more like construction
reporting and stuff like that.

339
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:18,129
So it's like a slide video with music
that you create using some tool and

340
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:19,899
you enter some text into it and so on.

341
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:23,239
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add a link to that.

342
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,989
And I'm going to say construction.

343
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:34,234
importance of construction reporting.

344
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:35,644
Okay.

345
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:47,424
And this is a slide video.

346
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:48,354
So I want to

347
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:51,164
stretch this out a bit so
that it's easier to see.

348
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:55,344
And I'm going to link to that
post, which is a Facebook video.

349
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:58,194
Now let's go back to
Facebook and keep going.

350
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:02,104
If we can see any other
type of videos in here.

351
00:19:02,994 --> 00:19:05,829
So again incident free operation site.

352
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:09,259
Oh, okay, that's a big number.

353
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:13,319
But, yeah Construction safety,
importance of construction safety.

354
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:14,969
But it's the same slide in blue.

355
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,079
Not very different,
just a different topic.

356
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,729
This is also a slide video, so I think
they publish a lot of slide videos.

357
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:25,279
Now let's go to YouTube and Instagram.

358
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:29,569
So we have YouTube and Instagram
here and you can see like all posts

359
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,289
in here, but if you click on real
specifically, you can see videos that

360
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,759
they're publishing and they have.

361
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:37,119
Okay.

362
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,609
They're repurposing the content
from Facebook to Instagram and

363
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:42,999
let's take a look at the next one.

364
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,479
The other one incident struggling
with contract management.

365
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:47,899
Again, it's a slide video.

366
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:52,829
Let's take a look at this one
productive while saving cost.

367
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:53,009
Okay.

368
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:54,469
All of these are slide videos.

369
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,929
So we know now know that there.

370
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:59,204
We are repurposing content from one
platform to the other platforms.

371
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,174
Again, in your case, you will
already know these things.

372
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,764
But because this is a client, I'm
just analyzing the other profiles.

373
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:07,614
Cool.

374
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:09,584
Now we have Instagram.

375
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,164
Let's take a look at
YouTube, YouTube, same thing.

376
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:15,414
They are just repurposing the content.

377
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,844
I think the primarily
creating it for YouTube.

378
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:21,974
And then they're repurposing it
for other social media platforms.

379
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:23,209
All right.

380
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,009
But these are good examples
of awareness focused content.

381
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,049
I'm not really like, I don't really
like them a lot, but these are good

382
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,679
examples of awareness focused content.

383
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:37,359
Now let's take a quick look at all the
other types of content they're posting.

384
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,919
All of these are short,
short video, short videos.

385
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,259
I can see the time codes over here.

386
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:43,919
You see the time times over
here, the durations of the video,

387
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,699
I can see the video durations
of the video in this corner.

388
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:49,189
So I'm just going through
them and trying to understand.

389
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:54,219
If all of them are videos like these,
okay, this one seems to be a bit longer.

390
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,499
Let's take a look at what that is.

391
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,819
So this is inventive.

392
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:00,999
So he's speaking at an event.

393
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:02,289
That's what's happening over here.

394
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:04,279
It's facing at the Nick Mark conference.

395
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,479
And I guess this is his
presentation during the event.

396
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,759
And it's somebody else at the company.

397
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:15,299
Okay.

398
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,079
A bit of engagement, not
many likes, very few views.

399
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,309
And the entire channel
is not performing well.

400
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,959
It's just publishing a bit of content.

401
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:28,464
So let's take a look at
what we can do over here.

402
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:38,924
Okay, so this is more like pain
points in the industry and then how

403
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:41,634
trace cost helps them with that.

404
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:46,934
Pain points in the industry, features
of trace cost, our journey so far.

405
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:50,834
Okay, so again, this is
awareness focused content.

406
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:53,174
So these are like what
would you call this?

407
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:59,254
These are, these are more like, I
would just say NICMAR conference.

408
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:02,004
conference speech.

409
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,184
All right I would enter
the name of the person.

410
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:13,324
So I know the name of the person
because we work with them.

411
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,494
But in your case, it'll be a team member.

412
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:16,754
So you can just include that.

413
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,994
Or you can ask around about who it is.

414
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:21,754
So his name is Shailendra Pennywall.

415
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:24,724
So I'm gonna include that over here.

416
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:29,874
And then let's add some stuff from
LinkedIn and Instagram as well.

417
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:32,494
So Facebook, Instagram.

418
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,844
YouTube stuff.

419
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:35,304
Other stuff is mostly the same.

420
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:37,064
I don't think those are good examples.

421
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,554
So let me look at LinkedIn.

422
00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:39,954
If they publish any videos on LinkedIn.

423
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,324
Now they don't publish any
video on the key profile.

424
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:45,744
Let's see the company page.

425
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,324
See if they publish something over there.

426
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,554
We can specifically look for
videos if you click on this.

427
00:22:51,844 --> 00:22:54,404
So these are four months ago.

428
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:55,674
Again, the same thing.

429
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,274
It's the same thing
that they're publishing.

430
00:22:57,924 --> 00:22:59,104
But that is getting some engagement.

431
00:22:59,104 --> 00:22:59,994
Okay, that's interesting.

432
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:03,114
Hmm.

433
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,024
Do you see delay?

434
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,834
Is it feeling stuck?

435
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:11,734
Okay, so

436
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:13,364
copy the link to the post.

437
00:23:16,254 --> 00:23:17,554
Yeah, too many hashtags.

438
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,184
Not very optimized for LinkedIn either.

439
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:21,604
So, I'm going to include that.

440
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:27,794
Say, budgeting and construction.

441
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:32,614
This is a LinkedIn video.

442
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,044
So, but repurposed.

443
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:40,494
Right?

444
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:42,114
I'm going to link that.

445
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:44,334
I'm not going to add
more examples over here.

446
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:47,624
I think slide videos are a good
idea, but they're not very good

447
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:50,714
to generate engagement because
again, there's slide videos.

448
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:55,144
And I think there needs to be a person
in the video speaking, or it needs to be

449
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:58,594
a really valuable actionable tutorial or
something for it to be a good slide video.

450
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:02,324
So this is not a format
that I'm very interested in.

451
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:05,634
So I'm going to not going to merge
these, I'm going to enter like

452
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:07,144
separate comments for each of these.

453
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:10,294
So this one, for example importance
of construction reporting.

454
00:24:11,064 --> 00:24:17,104
I'm going to say something along
the lines of it gives a big

455
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:26,424
overview on pay pounds
or issues in the niche.

456
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:27,194
All right.

457
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:28,074
So that's what it does.

458
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:36,814
But not very useful or insightful
for our target audience.

459
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:39,144
Now, why is it not very useful and
interesting for target audience?

460
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,839
Because think about a target audience,
a target audience of face cost the

461
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,309
company that we are analyzing, our
founders and CEOs of companies.

462
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,799
So they don't get like a lot
of value from doing this.

463
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,879
We can generate some brand awareness,
but that will be like, it is more

464
00:24:54,029 --> 00:25:00,899
interesting to say people who are in
other niches who would be interested

465
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,179
in understanding that reconstruction
has a problem like this, right?

466
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:07,209
But construction managers are already
aware that this problem exists, and

467
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:12,499
this video is too shallow of a topic to
explain, like, how it actually helps.

468
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:16,779
So if there's, like, a template or, like,
showing them actually how to how to, like,

469
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:20,569
budget properly then this would have been
helpful, but it's not, like, in depth

470
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,119
enough to explain how to budget properly.

471
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:24,879
It's just saying that budgeting
is a problem, and with the

472
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:25,939
right tools, you can solve it.

473
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,939
But and then we're just
pitching trace cost.

474
00:25:28,624 --> 00:25:30,124
Not really very interesting.

475
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:35,134
So I'm gonna say not very useful
or insightful for target audience.

476
00:25:35,454 --> 00:25:38,844
Now I have the same opinion
about budgeting and construction.

477
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:41,514
So I'm gonna move this a little bit up.

478
00:25:42,434 --> 00:25:43,634
Okay, we can't merge that.

479
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:46,514
So I'm just gonna copy
paste this over here.

480
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:54,984
And this one is something this
content is more about painpoints

481
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:58,669
And how trace call solves that.

482
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:06,199
But speeches at conferences
that add actionable value.

483
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:10,519
That add actionable value.

484
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:13,169
And basically end up more in depth.

485
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:17,629
Could be a good fit.

486
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:19,019
All right.

487
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:26,539
So I've just mentioned that,
and I'm gonna wrap it around so

488
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:27,709
that the whole thing, engineers.

489
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:31,719
Cool.

490
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:34,389
So now do you wish to create,
continue creating this content format?

491
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:36,819
This one is obviously, no, I
don't think it makes sense.

492
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:37,269
This one?

493
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:40,274
Yes, because I think speeches
can add a lot of value.

494
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:41,564
There should be a bunch of speeches.

495
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:45,484
They also recently attended conferences,
so I think if they've created some

496
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:47,074
content that that is something we can use.

497
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:50,119
Budgeting and construction LinkedIn
repurpose from other channels.

498
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,269
Again, I don't think that alternative
value it's too shallow, so I'm

499
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,299
going to mention no over here.

500
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:54,909
All right.

501
00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:57,759
Now let's take a look
at in depth blog posts.

502
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,889
So what do we look at in depth blog posts?

503
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:02,149
No, I already reviewed the blog.

504
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:05,349
I know that we don't have
any in depth blog posts.

505
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:09,419
So this is a section
that we have to start.

506
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,649
I'm just going to add a yes
over here because I think.

507
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,629
Adding more in depth content is important.

508
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:17,129
Strategy and how to focus LinkedIn posts.

509
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:19,179
So this is something that
we have to take a look at.

510
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,529
So let's take a look at
LinkedIn and see if they focus

511
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:23,979
on the strategy stuff, right?

512
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:27,239
So we've already reviewed the
content on the company page.

513
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:29,579
I didn't come across any in depth stuff.

514
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:32,819
I did come across some BOFU content,
bottom of the funnel content,

515
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,159
like testimonials and stuff.

516
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,589
But not much stuff is about...

517
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:37,829
Okay, I published an article.

518
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:38,749
Let's take a look at that article.

519
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,999
Streamlining construction process.

520
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:42,759
Oh no, again, too shallow, too shallow.

521
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,729
You see, it's too small.

522
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,709
So not very big.

523
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:48,859
I don't think there is
much MOFU content in here.

524
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:52,899
Let's take a look at this one.

525
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:57,539
Monitor productivity of assets
in project execution article.

526
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:04,279
No, it's not very in depth enough
to deliver like actionable value.

527
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:07,149
Now let's take a look at the
key profiles and see if they

528
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:08,259
are doing something over there.

529
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:09,789
That is MOFU.

530
00:28:14,634 --> 00:28:17,134
This is TOFU, Top of the Funnel.

531
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:18,714
This is also Top of the Funnel.

532
00:28:19,524 --> 00:28:20,954
This is an event news post.

533
00:28:21,904 --> 00:28:24,174
This is again, Top of the Funnel.

534
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:27,264
Statistics, Top of the Funnel.

535
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:29,024
Top of the Funnel.

536
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,344
Construction Backlog.

537
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:35,854
Top of the News or Trend article.

538
00:28:37,444 --> 00:28:38,634
Provide a safe environment.

539
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,004
How can construction work?

540
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:46,334
Okay, so rather than talk about, like,
say, how can you solve the problem of,

541
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:51,789
like, Work related debts because of
environmental heat exposure, like what

542
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:53,119
are some things that you can do about it.

543
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,199
It's not getting into
the in depth part of it.

544
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:55,969
It's just talking about it.

545
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,079
This problem exists and
you need to do something.

546
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,289
Construction companies must
continuously innovate, right?

547
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:04,009
It's not talking about
how to solve the problem.

548
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:08,639
So the how to part of it will be the
MoFo content, but that is not there.

549
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:13,569
So I'm just going to keep going and see if
we have any middle of the funnel content.

550
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:14,924
Industries.

551
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:15,564
No, nothing.

552
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:19,804
So I'm going to go back
and just enter it as yes.

553
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:23,964
There are not many there's
not much more for content.

554
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:28,154
And then I'm going to
just merge these as well.

555
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:32,074
And at nil, we don't have any, right.

556
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:34,984
And now we have strategy and
how to focus LinkedIn posts.

557
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:38,234
No, we already look at blog
post strategy and how to focus

558
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:39,654
LinkedIn posts are also missing.

559
00:29:40,294 --> 00:29:42,894
So I'm going to mark that as nil as well.

560
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:47,274
Video strategy, educational
focus, YouTube, Instagram related

561
00:29:47,274 --> 00:29:48,254
to the service or product.

562
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:49,644
Again, that is also missing.

563
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,814
We have a lot of more
content missing for this.

564
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:52,924
Front.

565
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,234
So white papers.

566
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:56,514
That is something we can look at.

567
00:29:56,514 --> 00:30:00,724
Now let's take a look at the website
and see if there are any white papers.

568
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:02,684
I'm going to close off the blog posts.

569
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:05,484
The Facebook sorry, Facebook stuff.

570
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:06,684
We may need to look at later.

571
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:07,634
So keep it open.

572
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,889
But let's take a look at, okay,
we have case studies, we have

573
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:13,749
demos, but do we have white papers?

574
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:14,869
Okay, let's take a look at this.

575
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,899
Investor, case studies,
about us, contacts.

576
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:18,859
Okay.

577
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:22,859
So you will be familiar, you'll
be aware of like what is existing

578
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:25,699
internally if you do this analysis
yourself, but here's the thing.

579
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:30,539
Sometimes white papers, etc, may not be
published internally, but then you may

580
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,039
have them like stored in a drive, etc,
even if it's not published on the website.

581
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:39,674
So this is the drive where we've stored
all of the the decks and the pitch

582
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:44,204
decks and some case study decks and some
product overview decks and, and stuff

583
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:48,894
like that that we send to clients and
prospects, but most of these are about

584
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:54,734
The product as opposed to white papers
that focus on a specific topic, say,

585
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:59,044
we do have one about AI and reality,
but this one is also about trace cause.

586
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:01,994
It's not very in depth, doesn't
fit the criteria for white paper.

587
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:06,684
So the white paper should ideally be
like, say, 90 over nine pages at least.

588
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:11,834
Should have some good content about it in
it that is not really focused on the on

589
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,214
the product of the service that we offer.

590
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:15,574
We can mention the product of the
service that we offer at the end

591
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:18,504
of the white paper, but ideally
the start shouldn't be about it.

592
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:23,244
It should be an interesting lead magnet
that users in your industry can download

593
00:31:23,454 --> 00:31:24,494
that they would be interested in.

594
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:27,754
It should be an interesting topic and
so on, but none of these are about it.

595
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:31,484
All of these are product decks, so we
don't really have any white papers.

596
00:31:31,784 --> 00:31:35,774
So what I would do is go back and,
and fill that as nil out as well.

597
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:40,704
So I'm going to fill white
papers as nil as well.

598
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:44,064
EBooks, same criteria as eBooks.

599
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:46,224
We don't have eBooks on this topic.

600
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:49,344
We do have some case studies and
product text, but not really eBooks.

601
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,404
Webinars and conferences.

602
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:53,414
Yes, we do have webinars.

603
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:53,604
Okay.

604
00:31:53,604 --> 00:31:54,534
That's a good one.

605
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:58,744
So I know for a fact that they don't have
any webinars, but if in case you want to

606
00:31:58,804 --> 00:32:01,734
see if we've published any webinars in
the past and you're not familiar with it,

607
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:11,704
you can just Google webinars and no, these
are all, all other stuff panel discussion,

608
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:16,894
CIOL, and for some reason, this one
turned up, let's see if we have webinars

609
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:20,754
somewhere over here, it's a different
website, so not really an owned webinar.

610
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:25,939
So I don't think we have
webinars for that fact.

611
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:28,519
So webinars are also a no no.

612
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:30,519
We don't have webinars yet.

613
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,489
So that is something we should be doing.

614
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:36,699
Again, my opinion in all of these is
that we should have it because more for

615
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:38,659
content is as important as TOFU content.

616
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:41,049
We do have a lot of TOFU content,
but we don't have more for content.

617
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:41,929
All right.

618
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:43,119
Podcasts.

619
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:46,109
No, I know for a fact that we
don't have a podcast, so we

620
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:47,939
can mention that as no as well.

621
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,879
So I just can drag this down to save time.

622
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:50,854
Newsletters.

623
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:53,254
I know for a fact that we
don't have a newsletter, but

624
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,414
you can check on the website.

625
00:32:54,484 --> 00:32:57,184
Most newsletters will be there on
the website and you can check that

626
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,064
and see if there is a newsletter.

627
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:00,744
If it's a LinkedIn newsletter.

628
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:02,494
So LinkedIn is a
newsletter feature as well.

629
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:09,734
And if you go in here on the profile and
click on articles, you should be able

630
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,414
to see if they are publishing articles.

631
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:16,124
So they seem to have some article, but
when we go on the article page, there

632
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,554
should be a newsletter icon over here.

633
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:20,574
There should be a newsletter
icon somewhere over here.

634
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:24,094
It should add the name of the
newsletter in here, but that is missing.

635
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:27,344
Now, let me give you an example
of what it will look like if

636
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:28,944
it is a newsletter on LinkedIn.

637
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:30,204
Okay.

638
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:32,894
I want you to cut out the portion
where I'm mentioning newsletters.

639
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:36,654
So I'm going to come back here and
start all over again about newsletters.

640
00:33:36,904 --> 00:33:40,284
So for newsletters, I know for a
fact that okay, start from here.

641
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:40,884
All right.

642
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,749
So for newsletters, I know for a
fact that we don't have newsletters.

643
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:45,899
I've marked it as nil and
yes, but here's the thing.

644
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:49,079
You can search whether you
have a newsletter on LinkedIn

645
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:51,229
or on on the website.

646
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,089
Best way is to just ask your team.

647
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:54,079
So you just go ahead and do that.

648
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:57,969
If you want to check on the profiles of
the key profiles just come to the profile

649
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,439
of the person you're analyzing the key
profile you're analyzing and come to the

650
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:05,659
activity section and you should be able to
see if they have a newsletter over here.

651
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:08,449
So it should look like
it should look like this.

652
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:12,234
So they have a newsletter, the newsletter
will be named over here, the subscribers

653
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:15,474
and like the recent posts in the,
in the newsletter, but if there's no

654
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:19,524
newsletter, it will show like this, there
won't be a newsletter tab over here.

655
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,354
So this person does not have a newsletter.

656
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:23,004
So we're going to move on.

657
00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:24,854
Now, we do have case studies.

658
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:26,944
We do have case studies
published on the website.

659
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,609
As well as the platform.

660
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:34,039
So the case studies have
not been published actively.

661
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:38,229
So let's take a look at the different
case studies that they have.

662
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:40,439
So they have a JMC case study.

663
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,079
That is quite good.

664
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:45,679
I'm not very in depth, but
they do have a JMC case study.

665
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,109
So I'm going to link to that.

666
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,219
Alright, I'm going to move
on to the next newsletter.

667
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,289
So the next one is QMS.

668
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:05,039
So, okay, so I guess they've used a
single slide to explain all the different.

669
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:07,094
features of the product.

670
00:35:07,924 --> 00:35:08,594
All right.

671
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:11,774
Is the other one is also a GMC case study.

672
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:13,864
Cool.

673
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:17,064
Let me look at the drive folder
as well to understand if they

674
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:19,264
have any other case studies.

675
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:23,624
So I just went through the files
in the drive and even there we

676
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,234
have only the GMC case studies.

677
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:29,364
It looks like not many case studies,
but case studies are really good.

678
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:31,094
You need to have case studies actively.

679
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:32,404
Let's look at this folder as well.

680
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:36,909
I can easily see that I've already gone
through them, but again, I can see that

681
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,729
they don't have many other case studies.

682
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:43,799
So we're going to move back and these are
good, but they need more case studies.

683
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,369
So I'm going to link to these anyway,
EHS, Employee Health and Management

684
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:53,999
System, so that we have it in one
place GMC Employee Health and Safety,

685
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:58,709
all right.

686
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,709
And close that off.

687
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:03,449
We have DPR Daily Progress Reporting.

688
00:36:05,669 --> 00:36:11,359
So that's GMC Daily Progress Reporting.

689
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:22,379
Contracts Management System.

690
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:38,429
Alright, I've linked all of them in here.

691
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:42,379
And the first one was it is all GMC.

692
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:44,159
So let's take a look at what
the first one was again.

693
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:46,419
Yeah, it's the same thing.

694
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:47,899
So I'm just going to delete this.

695
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:51,534
And how do you think this
helps our target audience now?

696
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:55,034
From my perspective, it gives
them an idea about the feature

697
00:36:55,064 --> 00:36:56,894
and it's the same for all of them.

698
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:59,264
So that is the pain points.

699
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,504
It gives them an idea of the pain points.

700
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:05,954
It provides a solution and it shows what
a solution is and what the impacts are.

701
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:07,694
So this is what I would do.

702
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:10,994
And they've done it with
a company called GMC.

703
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:15,344
All right.

704
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:18,934
So it's the same one
for all three of them.

705
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:29,084
So I'm going to merge the cells, and I'm
going to say it presents the challenges,

706
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:41,894
the solutions, and then presents our
solution, and then shows stats or reports

707
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:48,769
on how The solution helps the audience.

708
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:50,109
I would like to be a bit more detailed.

709
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:57,179
It should be a bit more
detailed and with lesser text.

710
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,679
That's my opinion on it.

711
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,959
But it can be done.

712
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:06,949
But it is useful.

713
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:25,064
Because it helps them understand
how the product Perfect.

714
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:29,994
Help them with similar, similar case.

715
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:30,684
Alright.

716
00:38:31,304 --> 00:38:32,134
And I've done that.

717
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:35,584
Now I'm gonna mark this, this.

718
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,134
And now would you wish to continue
creating this content format?

719
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:40,864
Heck yeah.

720
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,564
I think we need more case studies.

721
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:47,164
I could mention that feedback
over here but we need more case

722
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:51,584
studies from different clients.

723
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:53,154
Right.

724
00:38:53,224 --> 00:38:54,684
We need more case studies
from different clients.

725
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:57,864
I've included that in here and
now we have testimonial videos.

726
00:38:57,864 --> 00:39:01,194
So, we don't have testimonial
videos, we already took a look at

727
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:02,474
all the content that they have.

728
00:39:03,064 --> 00:39:05,184
Most of the content that they
have, but they're publishing from

729
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:07,994
some testimonial images and so on.

730
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:10,964
We came across like a few of
them, like one of this is this.

731
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:21,754
So this one, for example is
about why can't I copy this post?

732
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:21,934
Okay.

733
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:22,524
That's really hard.

734
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,839
It's a bit weird, but sometimes Facebook
doesn't allow you to send stuff.

735
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,229
So the only way to get the link is to
share it to somebody in your contacts.

736
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:36,689
So I'm just going to send it
to one of my own profiles.

737
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,509
And what that will do is it will
bring up the message in the chat and

738
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,139
you can, then you can copy the link
address and then paste it in the sheet.

739
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:48,789
It's a bit of a workaround around it,
but this is not really a testimony video.

740
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:50,229
This is more like an image post.

741
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:52,779
Testimonial.

742
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:56,739
There aren't any testimonial
videos for this line.

743
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,469
So I know for a fact.

744
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:01,889
I work with them, but
that is one testimonial.

745
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:05,909
And then there's one more testimonial
that we came across, which is this one.

746
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,739
So the same thing we are going
to share it to messenger.

747
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:12,699
And I'm going to send it to.

748
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:17,329
So you can send it to anybody, but it
should come it up, come up in here.

749
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:20,959
And then after it comes up in the
inbox, you can copy the link address.

750
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:24,289
Sorry, copy the link address
and then go back here.

751
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:30,389
And then include the, this is
also a testimonial image post.

752
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:33,339
And the name of the company
can also be included.

753
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:35,539
This is Broadcast Engineering Consultants.

754
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:40,739
Right, so Broadcast
Engineering Consultants.

755
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,449
That's the name of the company.

756
00:40:43,364 --> 00:40:50,294
I'd like to mention that in there
and let's add the name of the

757
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:52,174
company as well here as well.

758
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:56,164
So, these guys are called,
what is this called?

759
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:56,964
JMC projects.

760
00:40:56,994 --> 00:40:57,084
Okay.

761
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,344
This is the JMC guys.

762
00:40:59,034 --> 00:41:01,974
So link address oops, done.

763
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:02,244
So

764
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:16,884
we have two testimonials.

765
00:41:17,294 --> 00:41:18,504
Of course we would like.

766
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:20,809
to create more testimonials.

767
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:24,089
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to drag them, I'm going to merge it and

768
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,519
add a single comment for all of them.

769
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:34,239
And the comment is that we need more
testimonial videos rather than images.

770
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:40,609
And we need more of them.

771
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:41,679
Okay?

772
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:44,899
Now do you wish to continue
creating this content format?

773
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:45,429
Heck yeah.

774
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,919
I want to create way more
of this content format.

775
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:50,214
Because case studies and
testimonials are very important.

776
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:52,704
Demos, yes, we do have a demo.

777
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:54,314
We had linked to it somewhere over here.

778
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:55,634
So this is the page for the demo.

779
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:58,924
So all we need to do is link it over here.

780
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:01,524
We don't have like more
categories or types of demos.

781
00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:05,084
Free consultations, I guess the demo
qualifies as a free consultation.

782
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:06,284
So you just keep that over there.

783
00:42:06,764 --> 00:42:07,994
Competitive comparisons.

784
00:42:08,004 --> 00:42:11,684
So competitive comparisons compare
trace cost to some other product.

785
00:42:12,234 --> 00:42:13,934
But TraceCost doesn't seem to have it.

786
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,864
We're not comparing
ourselves to other products.

787
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:17,914
It should have been visible
on the blog otherwise.

788
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:21,774
But what I will do if you want to
find competitive comparisons is

789
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:27,184
go to the go to the search bar and
search for site colon our website.

790
00:42:27,184 --> 00:42:29,064
So that our website is TraceCost.

791
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:29,584
com.

792
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:34,044
Then what I would do is I would
enter something like this.

793
00:42:34,624 --> 00:42:38,244
TraceCost versus.

794
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:39,274
So.

795
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:45,354
This is the common criteria common,
like, say, title of, of topics of

796
00:42:45,414 --> 00:42:48,169
the blog post that we publish when
we do a competitive comparison.

797
00:42:48,169 --> 00:42:51,704
So you can search that, but I know
already that we don't have competitive

798
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:55,694
comparisons, so that is also something
that we should start focusing on.

799
00:42:56,184 --> 00:43:00,914
So I'm just gonna add it as nil
right now because we don't have it.

800
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,514
So I'm gonna copy that and I'm
gonna come in here and add.

801
00:43:05,434 --> 00:43:08,624
NIL for this and NIL for this.

802
00:43:08,884 --> 00:43:09,334
All right.

803
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:13,664
Regarding this, I'm just
going to enter how it helps.

804
00:43:14,164 --> 00:43:20,014
It helps users in the constructed space

805
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,154
evaluate our product

806
00:43:28,254 --> 00:43:28,694
before close.

807
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:30,734
That's the purpose of a demo, right?

808
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:36,154
All right we're gonna
move to customer stories.

809
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:38,794
We do have customer experience stories.

810
00:43:38,804 --> 00:43:41,644
So we took a look at LinkedIn
and we came across a few customer

811
00:43:41,644 --> 00:43:43,014
experience stories in the past.

812
00:43:43,524 --> 00:43:47,874
So let's go through LinkedIn and
spot that customer experience story.

813
00:43:49,884 --> 00:43:52,104
Where we found that Okay, not this one.

814
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:57,074
Was it in the user profile content?

815
00:43:57,114 --> 00:43:58,774
I think it was in the
user profile content.

816
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:01,354
So I'm going to switch to the
user profile, click on posts.

817
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:04,474
And see where it is.

818
00:44:09,434 --> 00:44:15,224
Okay, this is not, it's not this,
it's not this, it's not this,

819
00:44:19,494 --> 00:44:23,534
it's not this, it's not this.

820
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:38,604
Okay, not this either.

821
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:43,404
There was a post where they
said before trees cost.

822
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:50,834
So we're trying to spot that
specific one must unpause the video.

823
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:53,979
So this is the post.

824
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,519
This is our customer experience story.

825
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:59,619
But we're not naming customers, so
we should ideally be naming them.

826
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:02,189
But I'm going to link this in there.

827
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:04,939
This is the only customer
experience story that we have.

828
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,799
Just to be clear, the difference between
customer experience stories and I think

829
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:11,509
this one is about reducing Reducing.

830
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:25,609
Alright, so the difference between Case
studies and customer experience stories

831
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:29,449
is that case studies are more about
who the, who the, who the case studies

832
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:34,389
about introduction, introducing them,
then we have the problem that if they

833
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:37,429
were facing the solution we provided
for them and what results we generated.

834
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,919
So that is the the format
of, of a case study.

835
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:42,899
Customer experience stories are
about the experience of the customer,

836
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,439
ideally from their point of view.

837
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:44,729
So.

838
00:45:45,234 --> 00:45:47,214
This is how, this is the
problem that we're facing.

839
00:45:47,224 --> 00:45:51,174
This is how they found TraceCost or like
contacted Prubb or like somebody at,

840
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:53,164
at TraceCost was working at TraceCost.

841
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:55,284
This is how the initial conversation went.

842
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:56,674
This is why they converted.

843
00:45:57,024 --> 00:45:58,334
And this is what they did.

844
00:45:58,384 --> 00:46:00,914
These are the challenges that they
faced even after buying the product

845
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:02,074
and this is how we help them.

846
00:46:02,404 --> 00:46:06,494
So it's more about a perspective
of the interaction with the company

847
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:08,134
from the customer's point of view.

848
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:11,019
So these how do you think this
helps your target audiences?

849
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:21,229
I think this helps them understand
how the customer experience will be

850
00:46:21,229 --> 00:46:24,719
like with a real example of a client.

851
00:46:24,729 --> 00:46:25,739
So that's how it helps them.

852
00:46:26,189 --> 00:46:31,959
But we need more examples and stories

853
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:39,769
with multiple clients.

854
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:43,049
And we need, and we need what?

855
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:43,989
And we need

856
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:50,579
to mention client names, to name clients.

857
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,149
All right, so that's
what I would like to do.

858
00:46:54,149 --> 00:46:57,049
And yes, this is a content format
I would like to continue creating.

859
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:59,489
Now, we need product walkthroughs.

860
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:01,399
I'm going to merge all of this.

861
00:47:02,149 --> 00:47:03,119
So that it's easier.

862
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:09,639
And I'm going to merge these as well.

863
00:47:11,759 --> 00:47:12,099
All right.

864
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,669
Product walkthroughs or explainers.

865
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:18,319
Yeah, we do have some product
walkthroughs or explainers.

866
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:20,709
But these are in the drive.

867
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:25,009
So we do have some stuff
about how TraceCourse improves

868
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,559
construction performance fast.

869
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:28,389
So this is one example.

870
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:33,609
I'm going to copy that
and include it in here.

871
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:43,419
Now we need to link to it.

872
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:45,579
So I'm going to link.

873
00:47:45,784 --> 00:47:47,434
I add the link as well.

874
00:47:48,434 --> 00:47:52,004
I'm gonna go back and look at
more unlocking value in the

875
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:54,174
construction technology ecosystem.

876
00:47:54,954 --> 00:47:56,364
This is an example.

877
00:47:56,424 --> 00:48:03,834
I'm not really impressed by the quality
of it, but this is an example, so

878
00:48:04,494 --> 00:48:07,044
I'm going to link to that as well.

879
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:14,199
Ideally in the BOFU stage when you are
copying it, When you're adding the links,

880
00:48:14,709 --> 00:48:16,969
add the links to everything you can find.

881
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:20,779
So all the different case studies that
you have all the different testimonial

882
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:23,789
videos, demos, consultations,
competitive comparisons, customers,

883
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:27,569
just keep adding rows and include
all of them that are relevant.

884
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:28,659
So this is a single pager.

885
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:31,429
This is a case study.

886
00:48:32,939 --> 00:48:33,149
Yeah.

887
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:34,499
workflow solution.

888
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:36,469
So this is relevant.

889
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:39,829
So I would add this one as well.

890
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:42,589
And I would copy a link
to that one as well.

891
00:48:45,364 --> 00:48:46,974
Copy the link, done.

892
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,834
We don't really have
anything on the website.

893
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:50,504
I already checked.

894
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:55,054
But these are the product walkthroughs
and explainers that we have at the moment.

895
00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:58,174
So again, this helps
clients in the same fashion.

896
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,754
I'm going to merge those rows first.

897
00:49:03,384 --> 00:49:09,654
And the way this helps clients
is it gives the clients a good

898
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:14,624
overview of all the features.

899
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:18,019
The product.

900
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:21,789
Now it's common to think it's
easy to think that, okay, some of

901
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:24,879
these are just irrelevant because
it's obvious as to how this helps

902
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,599
clients or your target audience.

903
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:27,409
But here's the thing.

904
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:30,989
This is not just for you
to evaluate or analyze it.

905
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:34,869
It's also good for the entire
quantity to understand how each

906
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:38,929
of these content formats that we
use helps our target audience or

907
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:41,449
doesn't help our target audience or
what we need to improve about it.

908
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:45,249
So you can include as much details
as you can in this, in this column.

909
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:45,409
Okay.
