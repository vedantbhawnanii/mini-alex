1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,719
In this video, I'm going to walk you
through the content ideation sheet,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,350
where you'll be documenting a lot
of stuff from your own experiences,

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,839
struggles, successes, obstacles you
faced, your interests, pain points

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,899
in your industry, and your own
insights on your own target audience.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,190
This task is going to take quite a
while because you need to spend at

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,779
least 10 hours to fully complete it.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,299
But this step you can choose to do over
the course of a week or two when you

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,709
get some time, but maybe you're done.

9
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:31,015
While filling out the sheet properly,
it'll act as a good source of ideas

10
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:34,985
for your content team to come up
with content that has your own voice

11
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:36,464
and your own personality in it.

12
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:39,364
So they're going to be using
it a lot in the future.

13
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:43,285
So please make sure you spend some
time on the sheet and fill it out well.

14
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:46,615
Without further ado, let's jump
into the content ideation sheet.

15
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:49,795
So this is the content ideation sheet.

16
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,605
What I will do right now is I'll go
through each of these individual sections

17
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,644
and I will fill them out as an example.

18
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:58,865
But for the sake of this video,
I'm going to be filling them out as

19
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:03,005
myself for my own company and my own
industry, because it's very difficult.

20
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:05,875
To understand the exact pain points
that you want to focus on if you're

21
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:07,095
not working in that industry.

22
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:09,885
So I'm not going to use the case
study of trace cost, which we

23
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:11,115
used in the previous videos.

24
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:14,725
For this video, I'm going to be using
my own personality, my own background,

25
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,285
my own experiences and so on.

26
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:19,525
If you take a look at this sheet you can
notice that there are different sections.

27
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:21,835
So there's one section for
who is this content for this.

28
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:25,355
So this is outlining your different
personas or ideal customer

29
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:26,535
personas you're focusing on.

30
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,970
What their industry is, what
are the topics they care about,

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,100
what the influences, who the
influences in the space are.

32
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,070
There are anecdotal stories.

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,750
So these are all about
your own experiences.

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,240
So when you may have had a
major life change, so when you

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,340
went through a significant life
event, there are stuff about your

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,020
background and your tone of voice.

37
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,640
So that's about your date of
birth, where do you currently live?

38
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,480
What's your expertise?

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,540
How long have you been an
expert in your field and so on?

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,730
And there are problems in industries.

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,030
This is more industry focused.

42
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:54,245
your own interests in the space.

43
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,985
What are the lessons you
learned along the way?

44
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:57,685
What are the successes you've had so far?

45
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:58,965
What are the obstacles you face?

46
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,935
So it's a combination of both
industry stuff and your stuff.

47
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:06,655
Now for the industry stuff, like who this
content is for and what are the problems

48
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:12,365
in an industry, you can have like one
sheet for all the personal brands that

49
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,645
you're trying to create in your company.

50
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:18,095
But if you have multiple people in your
team who are creating content actively

51
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:23,365
and using the content process that we
coach you with in the program, you need

52
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:25,134
to create duplicates of this sheet.

53
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:27,744
So the content ideation sheet, you
need to duplicate it multiple times,

54
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:32,285
rename it and name it, say Alex content
ideation or RD content ideation, et

55
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,575
cetera, so that you have different
sheets for different people on your team.

56
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:38,695
You can just write like this and duplicate
it and then fill them out yourself.

57
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,465
So this, the section for the
industries can remain the same.

58
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,329
But the stuff on the anecdotal stories And
the background and tone of voice and your

59
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,579
interests, your lessons, your successes,
your obstacles, et cetera, needs to be

60
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,180
filled in separately for each team member
who's creating content on your team.

61
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,009
All right.

62
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,100
Now, the first step, when you get
started with the content ideation

63
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,430
is not to fill in the sheet.

64
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,120
The first step is to go through
the competitive analysis sheet.

65
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,695
I want you to spend at
least one hour on this.

66
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:09,705
So I want you to go through all
of these links in the sheet.

67
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:12,225
So if it's linked to the
sheet, go to it, try to get an

68
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,754
understanding of what this is.

69
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:17,705
So in the sheet, what we've done is
we've analyzed all of our competitors.

70
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:21,334
So we have five competitors that we've
analyzed in the sheet for this case study.

71
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:24,294
And we have their website,
their company page, any.

72
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:28,225
important LinkedIn profiles of key
team members, say the CXOs, VPs,

73
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,065
etc, who are active on LinkedIn.

74
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:34,295
We have their links to their Instagram,
Facebook, TikTok, YouTube channels, etc.

75
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:37,735
Then we have examples to individual
content pieces that are LinkedIn

76
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:40,825
content, the content formats they're
using on LinkedIn, what are the tone of

77
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,425
voice they're using on LinkedIn, etc.

78
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:46,145
We have top of the funnel content, which
includes short form blog posts, LinkedIn

79
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:47,965
posts, awareness focused LinkedIn posts.

80
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:49,715
News, trends, et cetera.

81
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:52,384
Then we have videos, LinkedIn
posts YouTube videos,

82
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:54,334
Instagram reels, et cetera.

83
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:57,664
We have middle of the funnel content,
which are in depth blog posts,

84
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:01,334
strategy and how to focus LinkedIn
posts, video strategies, reach

85
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:04,624
strategy focused videos, white papers,
e books, webinars, conferences,

86
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,154
podcasts, newsletters, et cetera.

87
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:09,874
And we have bottom of the funnel
content, which is case studies, testimony

88
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:13,144
videos, demos, free consultations,
competitive comparisons, customer

89
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:17,079
experience stories, and product
walkthrough videos or explainer videos.

90
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,559
And we have a summary of
each of these competitors.

91
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:24,019
What I want you to do is you need to gain
in some inspiration about this industry.

92
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:25,829
So you fill out the
content addition sheet.

93
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,089
That is the best way to do it.

94
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:31,069
So what I want you to do is go through the
entire competitor analysis sheet, open all

95
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,439
of these links, just skim through them.

96
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,709
It'll take like a minimum of a
maximum of like 10 seconds to just go

97
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,999
through each of these content pieces.

98
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,919
I don't want you to consume
them or read them through.

99
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:44,609
Just go through them and understand
what content topics and what formats

100
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:46,059
each of these competitors are using.

101
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,919
All right, the next step after you've
spent at least one hour on, like,

102
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,159
say, just going through all of the
content, you don't necessarily need

103
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,409
to spend one hour, but you need to
take a look at all of the links of

104
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:55,959
the sheet for all of the competitors.

105
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,079
But after you're done with
that, go to the existing content

106
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,069
analysis sheet and review it.

107
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:00,709
Take a look at it.

108
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,659
Go through each of these
links and see like what type

109
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:03,849
of content you are creating.

110
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,589
And then finally take a look at the
gap identification sheet and see

111
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,569
like, which, where do we have gaps?

112
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,689
So all of these marked as yes,
are the gaps that we have.

113
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:16,139
What gaps mean is
competitors are doing it.

114
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,149
We want to do it or we could
be doing it right now as well.

115
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,459
But we want to create content
with the ones that there are gaps.

116
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:25,109
We want to be actively
creating this content format.

117
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,729
All right.

118
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,729
So these are marked as yes.

119
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,179
Now we're not making any decisions on
which content formats or which topics

120
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:32,529
you're creating content on at this point.

121
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:37,244
This is just so that you internalize the
idea that, okay, these are the pieces

122
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,784
that they need to get inspiration from.

123
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:42,174
So you will gain inspiration from
the content linked in here and this

124
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,974
will help you a lot when you fill
out the content evaluation sheet.

125
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:45,814
All right.

126
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:48,424
So the first step, you go
through the step by step.

127
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:52,134
You need to spend at least two hours
separately for filling out the sheet.

128
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:55,444
Ideally, you need to be filling out all
sections or including some detail in all

129
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:59,404
of these sections so that your content
team understands a bit more about your

130
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:01,734
personality, what your tone of voice.

131
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:06,609
Your background experiences that you've
had, the struggles, et cetera, as well

132
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:10,129
as some things about the pain points in
the industry and who this content is for.

133
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,019
All right.

134
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:14,719
And now I'm going to go ahead and
fill this sheet out one by one.

135
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:18,089
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to fill this in my perspective.

136
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,279
I'm not going to fill
out the entire sheet.

137
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,709
I'm going to fill out, let's say,
a couple of rows for each of these

138
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:24,129
sections so that you understand
how to fill this out properly.

139
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:27,699
Now, with that said, I'm going to go
ahead and fill this out one by one.

140
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:31,009
So the first section is for
who is this content for?

141
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,969
So I'm going to fill out
like one of our personas.

142
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:37,549
So one of our personas is
SaaS founders and CHOs.

143
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:39,284
All right.

144
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:44,654
So the industry that I want to focus
on right now is assume I'm focusing

145
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:49,654
on Texas, but within Texas, like what
type of SAS do I want to focus on?

146
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:55,564
So what I want to ideally focus on
at the moment is SAS in the VC space.

147
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:58,404
So SAS in the VC space.

148
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:04,694
So that's again, my own opinion, my
own persona, it will be very different

149
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:07,744
for you, but I'm just doing it because
that is what I want to focus on.

150
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:11,904
So the topics that they want
to care about is the economy.

151
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:15,704
So I'm just going to add like a
list of like stuff that from the

152
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:18,294
top of my mind, I don't need to
do a lot of research on those.

153
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:19,774
These are just things
from the top of mind.

154
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:24,824
They focus on the economy, they focus
on hiring strategy is important for

155
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:29,514
them, they focus on fundraising,
topics like fundraising, they

156
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:32,614
focus on venture funding use.

157
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:36,334
So that is something that they
keep abreast of all the time.

158
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:46,024
They focus on startup hubs, they focus
on startup training or accelerator.

159
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:49,724
So you get where I'm going with this.

160
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:53,144
So in my opinion, what are the
topics that this person cares about?

161
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:55,074
So that's what I'm including in here.

162
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,164
I think this is enough.

163
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:56,974
You can include more.

164
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,754
You can go, you can
spend some time on this.

165
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:02,284
Now the next one would be to include
some influencers in the space.

166
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:06,184
Now these are influencers that I've heard
about that I follow, that I know about.

167
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:09,554
It could be brands or it could
be people that I can follow.

168
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:12,334
So I know a bunch of influencers
in the space, say for

169
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,524
example, Ganymede and Chuck.

170
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:16,224
is an influencer that I tend
to follow in this space.

171
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:21,704
Tiger Global is another influencer
that I tend to follow in this space.

172
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:26,454
And then after Tiger Global, we have
Y Combinator, which is one of the

173
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,264
largest accelerators in the world.

174
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:29,924
It produces a lot of good content.

175
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:30,804
I consume it as well.

176
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:32,904
Belling is a raw, raw generator.

177
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,604
And we also have Google for Startups.

178
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:38,274
Google for Startups also
pushes out a lot of content.

179
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:41,144
And then we have Startup
Weekend is a good one.

180
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:44,094
But other than Startup Weekend,
I think Techstars is a good brand

181
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,544
that I would like to follow.

182
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:48,099
These are all supposed
to act as inspiration.

183
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,129
Now, what I will do is I will hyperlink
this with the links, the profiles.

184
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,719
So if it is people like Gary Vaynerchuk,
I can link to their profiles.

185
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,229
If it is companies, I will
link to their company pages.

186
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:58,879
So I'm going to go ahead
and do that right now.

187
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,179
So I've included the links to all of them.

188
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,239
Of course there can be better examples.

189
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:07,139
You will have better examples as well, but
these tend to be the ones that I follow.

190
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:08,399
I constantly consume the content.

191
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,919
So I will include them in here.

192
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,949
You can do some additional research
if you're not familiar with good

193
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:14,459
influencers, or if you want to.

194
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:17,529
Only include good influences
you can gain inspiration from,

195
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:18,419
you can go ahead and do that.

196
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:22,789
But ideally, these need to be good
examples of people who are doing a very

197
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,529
good job of creating content in the space.

198
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,099
And then we move on to anecdotal stories.

199
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:31,419
Anecdotal stories are all
about your experiences.

200
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,269
Say for example, you
had a major life change.

201
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:36,549
So these are all examples of
what you see over here are

202
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,839
all example template content.

203
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:41,339
So you started a new job into soul
crushing, just a skydiving instructor.

204
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:44,169
You realize that you're afraid of heights
and didn't like this line of work.

205
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,039
Good after a few days felt a lot better.

206
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:48,989
You had to write out your resignation
after only two hours of employment.

207
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,489
So we have different sections in here.

208
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:55,069
So we have a section for, say, a short
and quick summary about the experience, a

209
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:58,279
background info, a two to three sentence
elaboration, the moments of highest

210
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,149
drama, how did it make you feel, how did
it make others feel, what does it make

211
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,954
you realize, what is the lesson learned.

212
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:06,284
Over time, when you fill this
out, this will give really good

213
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:10,944
ideas for your content team to add
flair and your personality's flair

214
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,094
in the content that you create.

215
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,344
The content can be on very
different topics, may not be

216
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:15,954
really about a major life change.

217
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:20,294
But they can include snippets of
these experiences inside, like

218
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:23,104
say, an industry relevant post
or a customer experience story.

219
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:26,694
So that it adds your personality's
flair and that will greatly

220
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:27,894
impact the effectiveness.

221
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,509
of LinkedIn Content Marketing.

222
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,609
So, I'm going to fill out some of this.

223
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:35,399
I'm just going to quickly go
through this and fill it out.

224
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:38,479
Made a short term
sacrifice for a big gain.

225
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:42,589
Yeah, so a summary of this
experience that I want to fill out.

226
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,819
Okay, made a short term
sacrifice for a big gain.

227
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:51,789
Would be, I was one of
the lowest paid members.

228
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,519
You know what, I was not one
of the lowest paid members,

229
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,669
I was the lowest paid member.

230
00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:02,719
I was the lowest paid member of
my team in the first two years

231
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,999
of my contract.

232
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:21,969
Now, the story, I was struggling
with cashflow and I wanted to invest

233
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:28,119
everything back into business.

234
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,259
And through my agency.

235
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:31,109
Alright.

236
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:33,109
So that is what I wanted to do.

237
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:33,809
And then.

238
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:38,029
Now let me add some background
information over here.

239
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,949
So what is the background information
and the two to three sentence

240
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,449
elaboration that we can add over here.

241
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:46,369
So the background information
is something along the lines of.

242
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,229
When we began.

243
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,389
We had a huge traction.

244
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,129
On LinkedIn.

245
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:54,999
With our content.

246
00:11:56,979 --> 00:12:04,609
And we had a lot of clients
approaching us for our services.

247
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:11,619
But I was an amateur business founder.

248
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:19,369
I did not understand how to manage
cash flow and be profitable.

249
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:24,199
So I earned money.

250
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:35,754
on unwanted experiments, unwanted
hires and fancy growth hacks and=

251
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:45,984
did not be focused on building
a profit, profitable business.

252
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:47,144
All right.

253
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:50,934
Now, what is the moment of highest drama?

254
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:52,984
I remember the moment of highest drama.

255
00:12:53,159 --> 00:13:01,779
One being unable to travel back home
to my parents, visit my parents,

256
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:15,569
parents, because I would have not
thought the cheapest train seat.

257
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,739
This is a true story.

258
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:17,099
All this when we

259
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:33,129
were generating about I don't know
the thing which I made about 80K USD

260
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:39,829
revenue per month but our expenses

261
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:45,859
were non consistent

262
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,799
higher more than

263
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:56,673
what we indicated.

264
00:13:56,673 --> 00:14:08,344
Alright, I had already borrowed
from most of My contacts, who

265
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:12,094
I couldn't borrow money from.

266
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:20,984
And I was too embarrassed
to ask for money again.

267
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:22,944
Right?

268
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,924
So what these prompts like
these in this columns do is

269
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:27,784
they give you food for thought.

270
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:34,484
They direct your thought to creating
good, to adding good stories

271
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,814
about your experiences and so on.

272
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:37,974
Now, how did it make me feel?

273
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:41,584
Yeah, I'm actually, I'm going to
copy paste this because it made

274
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:48,064
me feel both trapped and miserable

275
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:51,684
300 miles from my home.

276
00:14:52,044 --> 00:15:01,624
My hometown and my family, I'm
trying hard day and night to build an

277
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:13,354
agency, chasing my dream, even being
somewhat successful with it, but not

278
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:18,234
understanding what was going wrong.

279
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:22,164
I was clueless.

280
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:33,929
As to how I could resolve the
issues, because I was facing

281
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,049
the same issue for months.

282
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:41,109
So this thing went on for months.

283
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,969
Now, how did it make others feel?

284
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:51,689
Team members, both freelance team members.

285
00:15:52,329 --> 00:16:04,969
Consultants we worked with and my
small startup team were concerned.

286
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:15,469
They saw that I was always tired, always
stressed could never follow a team

287
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,159
because I was staying up nights.

288
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:28,324
properly with follow routine and
there were always delays in payments.

289
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,804
This made me realize

290
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:50,394
that irrespective of how many clients we
were landing how much brand awareness.

291
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,579
We were writing on LinkedIn.

292
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,589
I, it wouldn't be a business.

293
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:00,309
We have business.

294
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,399
Until we generated positive gas.

295
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,849
This wasn't a charity.

296
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:16,879
To

297
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,969
keep losing money.

298
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,119
I

299
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,319
had to figure out a solution.

300
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,989
So that's how I made me feel.

301
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,289
And then next we need to talk
about what is the lesson learned.

302
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,239
So that is about the lesson learned.

303
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:43,519
But I think the lesson I learned was
that I should stop focusing on sales

304
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:53,759
and marketing, start focusing on
building and op steam for more to shade.

305
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:55,179
Yeah, that's a blow.

306
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:56,589
Structure.

307
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,079
Processes.

308
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:11,389
That we didn't have to
keep running expensive

309
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,689
experiments for every
client we worked with.

310
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:32,879
And that included niching down
The focus on one single Service

311
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:42,069
proposition rather than offer
all types of marketing services.

312
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,269
All right, so I fill that out.

313
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:46,649
Yep.

314
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:50,339
And then finally, we have any other
details that might be important.

315
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,399
Well, what is another detail
that might be important?

316
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:52,719
Yeah.

317
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:56,099
So I could mention like the result
of what happened at the end.

318
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,999
I found a CEO in Canada.

319
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:14,494
That and with his help, we structured
the entire service delivery process.

320
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:20,004
And I handed off all the hiring to him.

321
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:20,034
Okay.

322
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:28,594
Then we niche down to only
offer LinkedIn marketing.

323
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:38,359
Which saved us a lot of, let's say,
money at the same time on my time.

324
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:41,219
Okay.

325
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:51,789
It also, I started paying myself more as
soon as I as the cash flow issues were

326
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:58,429
resolved after we did both of the above.

327
00:19:58,539 --> 00:19:59,039
That's it.

328
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:03,564
We have a very good experience that
our content team can learn from,

329
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:07,454
which is about our personality about
our previous experiences and so on.

330
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:10,734
So that's how we fill out the anecdotal
stories put some time into this.

331
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:14,994
This one took like 10 minutes to put
some time into this and, and add a

332
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:19,124
couple of experiences and do not hesitate
to keep like spend some time on this

333
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:20,674
every week to do the whole thing.

334
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:23,994
But the next section is the
background and tone of voice.

335
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:26,744
These are simple to fill, like
my, my birthday, for example, is

336
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:29,644
in December 20, in December 1992.

337
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:38,594
Where do I travel a lot,
but mostly in Bangalore with

338
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:42,554
a team

339
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:54,004
with city and country from, of course,
I'm from I'm from South India, so I'm

340
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,864
just going to enter South India in here.

341
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:57,914
Because that's where I'm from.

342
00:20:58,094 --> 00:20:59,284
What do you want to achieve in life?

343
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:04,364
I think a positive impact for everyone.

344
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:07,494
I want to,

345
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:23,514
to be a force for everyone
around me and beyond, right?

346
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:26,694
Again, that is not some generic
stuff and it's just filled out

347
00:21:26,694 --> 00:21:27,744
for the sake of filling it out.

348
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,344
This is what I want to do.

349
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:30,904
I filled this sheet out like 20 times.

350
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:32,614
So what's your expertise?

351
00:21:32,654 --> 00:21:38,004
I would say my expertise includes
everything from marketing to generation.

352
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:42,684
I'd say content marketing is
one of my core skill sets.

353
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,774
I would say process design is
something that I'm good at.

354
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,404
Copywriting is something I'm good at.

355
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:53,754
Coaching is something I'm good at.

356
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:57,774
So all of the skills that I want to
include, I can include them in here.

357
00:21:58,674 --> 00:21:59,754
So go through these.

358
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:02,444
These are very good questions that
will help you understand better about

359
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:07,214
yourself and help your team understand a
lot about you so you can fill this out.

360
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:09,474
That's okay.

361
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:09,884
Okay.

362
00:22:09,884 --> 00:22:10,494
Completely.

363
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,144
I'm just going to fill it in here for now.

364
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:14,394
And then we have what
the problems in industry.

365
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:18,344
So in my opinion, the biggest problem
in this industry, my industry.

366
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:26,849
Which is LinkedIn marketing, is
that most businesses haven't yet

367
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:31,919
seen good examples of r o I positive

368
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:45,609
LinkedIn funnels which needs
them to consider it just as any

369
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:50,229
other social media platform.

370
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:53,569
That is a big pain point
in, in this industry.

371
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,799
So, you could describe your
solution for this industry.

372
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:02,049
So, my solution for this industry
is create more content that is

373
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:10,779
actionable enough for them to
execute, to generate better results

374
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:15,239
on LinkedIn, with the help of a...

375
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:21,189
Real case studies of clients
we use for them, right.

376
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,929
So that would be a good
solution for this in my opinion.

377
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,969
So this is how you fill out the problems
in your industry and how you would solve

378
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:37,859
them or you could expand the point or you
could state your own opinion about this.

379
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:38,239
All right.

380
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:39,899
Now, what are my interests?

381
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:40,979
What are my core interests?

382
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:43,629
So my core interest is, is traveling.

383
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,189
Traveling is something that
I would include, but that's

384
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:46,529
a generic interest, right?

385
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,539
Specifically, what in
traveling do you like?

386
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:51,999
What in writing do you like?

387
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:55,199
So I'm going to write more
along writing content.

388
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:58,419
So it's a brief thing
about writing content.

389
00:23:58,449 --> 00:23:59,649
Now describe when this happened.

390
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,939
When did I start writing
content on LinkedIn?

391
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:06,819
So it started back in 2018.

392
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:16,899
And I started documenting my journey
of building an agency on LinkedIn.

393
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,019
All right.

394
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:22,659
Now, tangible moments, cite the
conversation or describe the feeling

395
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,909
around this, around this specific
interest, personal interest.

396
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:31,644
So, I think it was, I stumbled,
so very specific conversation.

397
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:46,024
I stumbled across Google Sheets that was
linked, linked to a form on my LinkedIn

398
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:54,574
profile, contact form on my LinkedIn
profile, and this form had 40 links.

399
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:04,374
This happened two months after
I started posting on LinkedIn.

400
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:10,234
I lost all but one of those leads.

401
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:20,279
And it's helped me close my first
new client from when I started.

402
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:23,449
I founded my agency.

403
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:34,589
The moment I realized that I had missed
out, I had not responded to party needs.

404
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:45,564
Just because I wasn't paying attention
to the form entries I just couldn't

405
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:51,924
help but shout poorly, okay, that's a
bit of profanity, but that's exactly

406
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:59,314
what I said, loud, out loud, in the
co working space that I was working.

407
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:01,399
That's it.

408
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:05,769
One thing that you need to note over here
is assuming that if you publish something

409
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:08,829
like this, if, if like your copywriters
take, take inspiration from this and

410
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:12,589
publish on something along these lines,
some ideas that lines from these on

411
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:14,239
your LinkedIn profile, it may look good.

412
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,274
So there is a common perspective that it
is not a good idea to share unprofessional

413
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:19,299
stuff, unprofessional stuff on LinkedIn.

414
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,609
That is absolutely not true.

415
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:26,669
In fact, the more vulnerable you are
with your content, better your results

416
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,889
will be from your content marketing.

417
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:32,909
We do talk about this a lot in the content
creation steps in the program, but it's

418
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:34,789
good to be vulnerable in the sheet.

419
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:38,059
Like, so when you want to talk
about your interests, your problems

420
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:40,919
your background and tone of voice,
please be as vulnerable as possible,

421
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,659
but be very authentic and honest.

422
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:46,049
Because authenticity and
vulnerability goes a long way.

423
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:52,204
Right now that was the interest section,
and now we have the lesson section.

424
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:56,104
So in the lesson section, these are about
lessons, learning lessons that we learned.

425
00:26:56,464 --> 00:27:01,384
So one of the learning lessons
that I learned is that unless

426
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:07,264
you have, let's see, s d r work,
s d r, I could say p d r work.

427
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:08,124
So business development.

428
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:18,214
in the inbox is one of the primary reasons
why LinkedIn outreach does not work.

429
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:19,684
Alright?

430
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:23,554
Now what I mean by this is assume
you're sending a bunch of outreach

431
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:24,904
messages on LinkedIn, right?

432
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:27,604
You will get like a lot
of responses from people.

433
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:31,604
But most of the responses assume
90% of the responses won't be people

434
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:34,044
who are, who are like straight
away interested in buying your

435
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,094
service or your product from you.

436
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,129
Most of them will be like a thumbs up
or thank you, or I'll keep you in mind

437
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:40,709
or something like generic responses.

438
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:43,259
Many of them will be saying,
saying they're not interested.

439
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:46,199
So what you need to do is you need to
have somebody on the team or you need

440
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:50,519
to handle this yourself to nurture those
conversations step by step, track each

441
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,949
of those conversations, and eventually
get them to a stage where they're

442
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:56,689
interested in talking to you about
your service or product and then get

443
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,049
them on a call and try to close them.

444
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:02,449
So if that process is absent, your
lead generation on LinkedIn would

445
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,219
be like one tenth of what it can be.

446
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,319
And it may not become ROI positive.

447
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:09,079
So that is a lesson I learned
a couple of years ago.

448
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,599
It took a lot of time to learn that lesson
because I thought we could just reach

449
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,769
out, pitch people or publish content.

450
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:18,159
People will reach out to me when the
truth is you'll get way better ROI.

451
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:22,234
If you are spending a lot of
time in the inbox, a couple hours

452
00:28:22,274 --> 00:28:25,714
every day in the inbox, nurturing
people who are responding to you.

453
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:27,674
Okay, now when did I realize this?

454
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:31,484
I realized this only in my third year.

455
00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:34,484
Tangible moments, side the
conversation or describe the feeling.

456
00:28:34,674 --> 00:28:37,614
Our clients, so we can
be detailed over here.

457
00:28:37,664 --> 00:28:41,044
I'm going to say something like
our clients they're generating

458
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:45,254
results, but if they're not...

459
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:46,674
Impressive.

460
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:53,084
Being generated our coffee needs
every month with content and

461
00:28:53,144 --> 00:29:01,014
outreach, but nothing to the level
that we would continue us a month.

462
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:08,534
We were doing outreach, we
were creating and publishing

463
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:12,374
conduct, but that wasn't enough.

464
00:29:12,944 --> 00:29:14,024
We had to.

465
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:21,739
Delta patients prospects.

466
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:21,769
Wow.

467
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,049
I remember saying to Nikhil, so this
is the tangible of the conversation

468
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,819
to Nikhil when I organized this.

469
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,209
This is the last.

470
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:51,364
That's part of the process
we we can stop scaling.

471
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:52,094
That's it.

472
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:54,854
And now we move on to the next
section, which are what are the

473
00:29:54,864 --> 00:29:56,234
successes you've had so far.

474
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:59,194
So we've actually, okay,
there's a lot of successes.

475
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:02,659
But I think one of the major
successes is someone writes about

476
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,869
when we formed partnerships.

477
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:09,449
So partnerships are some of the biggest
successes in terms of both the revenue

478
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,949
and the learning that we, that we gained.

479
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:15,819
I think one of the biggest
successes is partnering Alex

480
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:17,259
for IG that's Imagine Front.

481
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:17,349
Great.

482
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:20,904
See, that's step by step.

483
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:22,964
LinkedIn training program in the world.

484
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:23,864
When did this happen?

485
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:27,674
This happened early, you
know, I think it was 2021.

486
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:32,404
See, there were multiple
tangible conversations but

487
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:33,804
tangible that I can recall.

488
00:30:34,204 --> 00:30:39,804
But I think one that really stood out
was, I remember saying to Alex, after my

489
00:30:39,844 --> 00:30:47,924
first partnership fell through, I made
the decision that we wouldn't do it again.

490
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:54,069
But now, I want to make a bet on this.

491
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:57,309
Okay, and Alex said along the
same, same thing Alex replied.

492
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:02,149
Creative of partnering with strangers.

493
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:04,519
But, we'll see the value.

494
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:07,404
Yep.

495
00:31:07,954 --> 00:31:09,684
That is a tangible moment
of the conversation.

496
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:10,924
I could include more details as well.

497
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:17,284
I think the learning lesson was
past experiences may earn us and

498
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:26,600
make us set our minds and set our
minds to things that may not be

499
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,938
beneficial for our long term growth.

500
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:34,389
We need to come to terms with it.

501
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:43,229
Previous experiences or past
experiences and get over them and

502
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:53,649
still choose what's right for our
own growth and the growth of those

503
00:31:58,329 --> 00:31:58,449
that are in our journey.

504
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,759
Alright, now that's a good lesson.

505
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:02,234
So that's it with the successes.

506
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:04,724
So the most of our success just
as you add achievements, you can

507
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:08,424
add achievements about getting
covered in ink magazine or Forbes.

508
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:11,464
So you can add achievements about
hiring the right team member.

509
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:15,254
We can have success successes about
landing big clients or like some

510
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:18,014
client that you've always wanted
to work with and so on in here.

511
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:19,394
So those are successes.

512
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:20,444
And then we have obstacles.

513
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:24,654
So obstacles are about challenges that
you faced while building a business.

514
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:26,279
or building a process.

515
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:30,819
So I think one of the biggest
challenges was not having good

516
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,009
content management process.

517
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:48,109
So without this we were spending 2 to
3x the amount of time not doing work but

518
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:52,579
just coordinating work between teams.

519
00:32:53,074 --> 00:33:02,954
It is multiple team members were involved
in the creation of FTP support, right?

520
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:04,604
And now, when did this happen?

521
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:06,954
This I think we, we
started facing this issue.

522
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:09,884
This issue was a constant issue

523
00:33:10,394 --> 00:33:16,654
from when we started offering
intermarketing service to when we offered.

524
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:29,624
board and cost tracking system
in I believe this is in 2021.

525
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:30,434
Okay.

526
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:30,854
Tangible.

527
00:33:30,854 --> 00:33:31,874
Will side the conversation.

528
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:32,774
Describe the feeling.

529
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:36,484
I think, think we were
spending like around a hundred

530
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:38,844
dollars, a hundred for say

531
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:44,824
it's a limited text person.

532
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:53,099
So this happened when I realized I said
this when I realized that we calculated

533
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:56,589
the the expenses for creating and
publishing a single piece of content.

534
00:33:56,969 --> 00:34:01,079
So we realized that the content itself,
getting it written by the copywriters

535
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,104
was taking like a lot of time.

536
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:07,334
And in between like 10 and 20,
but say the different team members

537
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:11,144
coordinating each piece of content,
somebody reviewing it somebody

538
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:12,914
adding it, tracking it in one place.

539
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:16,284
We were using multiple trackers to track
the link to the post or the link to the

540
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:20,374
Google doc where it was shared, stored,
and then multiple team members handling

541
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:23,784
it, somebody else publishing that piece
of content and then promoting that content

542
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:25,184
and then engaging with all the comments.

543
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,134
And then that's for
putting it to the client.

544
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:30,834
So the entire creation to publishing
to promotion stage for a single piece

545
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:35,984
of content is costing us way more than
100 USD for the link, singling exposed.

546
00:34:35,984 --> 00:34:37,384
And these are textbooks, not even videos.

547
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:39,434
So that was something
I mentioned in nickel.

548
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:41,624
And that is when I said something like.

549
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:42,974
Letter.

550
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:48,754
I think the learning lesson from this
was, okay, let me just grab the, I was

551
00:34:48,874 --> 00:34:58,854
frustrated and, and just being like that
this was one of the biggest cost suckers.

552
00:35:03,354 --> 00:35:05,724
That's on the same process, right?

553
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:07,344
And now we have the learning lesson.

554
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:18,884
We have to use a task platform so that
on the entire team would be on the

555
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:31,284
same page about each and every task
without having to get on a call to ask.

556
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:33,969
All right.

557
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:36,049
Now that is the learning lesson.

558
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,459
So this is how you fill out
the content edition sheet.

559
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:42,039
I've given you some examples
for each of these sections.

560
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:46,179
So what I want you to do is you
don't need to limit it to one hour.

561
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:49,069
We spent almost one hour
just going through this.

562
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:52,979
But I did spend a couple hours,
assume like one to two hours each

563
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:57,119
week for the next four weeks, and
then try to properly finish this out.

564
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,979
Over time, this will be
a very good repository.

565
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:04,954
of, of content ideas that will portray not
just your personality, but also about the

566
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:09,084
industry and like which personas you want
to focus on, which pain points you want

567
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:13,414
to talk about, problems or pain points are
faced by your target audience, et cetera.

568
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:17,644
And these ideas in the anecdotal
stories, your struggles your interests,

569
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:23,754
et cetera, will help your team, your
content team on LinkedIn help you

570
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,774
create, help you have that flair
of your personality in the content.

571
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:31,839
So, that sums up with this video and this
was one of the last videos in this module.

572
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:36,489
So, you can go ahead and get started
with creating your own content ideation

573
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:39,979
sheet, your own content analysis sheet
and filling this sheet out properly.

574
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:44,594
But what I'd recommend is spend some
time On this every week for the next

575
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:48,934
few weeks and just fill this out a lot,
as many ideas as possible so that your

576
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:53,864
team can have really good idea about
your personality and the industry.

577
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:58,724
My opinion would be to fill at
least four rows in this section,

578
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:00,664
ten rows in this section.

579
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:02,504
So that's the anecdotal story section.

580
00:37:03,174 --> 00:37:05,264
Background tone of voice,
fill it out completely.

581
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,304
No exceptions, just
fill it out completely.

582
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:11,594
And then problems in an industry
include at least seven different

583
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:13,054
problems in this section.

584
00:37:13,434 --> 00:37:16,284
Then interest, you can just need
to include like five interests.

585
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:18,124
Lessons you learned are important.

586
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:21,114
So include at least six lessons in there.

587
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:24,064
Then we have successes,
include at least six successes.

588
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:27,124
Obstacles you face include
at least six obstacles.

589
00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:30,724
This is a very good section for you
continue to understand like challenges

590
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:32,104
we face and how we overcame them.

591
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:33,904
That's good content areas.

592
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:34,864
So.

593
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,089
That's it for this video.

594
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:38,869
You can go ahead and start the work now.

595
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,339
See you in the next video.
