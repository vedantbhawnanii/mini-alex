1
00:00:01,442 --> 00:00:06,444
So, the next content format we are going to be
discussing are slide posts. Now, slide posts

2
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:12,086
are one of the best performing content formats
on LinkedIn right now. And it's basically just

3
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:17,348
a PDF post that is designed that you design
that has a bunch of text and images in it.

4
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:22,791
And you talk about a story, it can be a guide,
step-by-step guide. It can be a listicle of

5
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:27,493
like seven top construction projects or something
like that. This one is a story about how the

6
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:32,303
Brooklyn Bridge was created. by a woman who
was the wife of the original chief engineer.

7
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:37,207
So it's an interesting story in construction,
which is why we chose the story, and we created

8
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:43,031
a slide post about this. Now let's first take
a look at the content management process in

9
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:48,475
ClickUp for the slide post. And then let's talk
about how to ideate and create these posts.

10
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:56,820
So this is the ClickUp template task for slide
posts. And just as usual, we have everything

11
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:03,469
detailed for you in sub-tasks, as well as checklists
for each subtask. So for outlines, we have

12
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:08,552
a checklist for outlines. For the graphs, we
have a checklist for outlines explaining exactly

13
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:15,537
what to do step by step for creating slide posts.
Now, the process is very similar to that of

14
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:22,322
experiences stories, but the only difference
is that here, there is an awaiting media file

15
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:30,147
designing step where the carousel or the slides
are designed by a designer or personalized

16
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:38,014
by a designer and reviewed by the content manager
and reviewed by the executive. So one thing

17
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:43,339
here is that the drafts are first created by
the copywriter and then the content manager

18
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,843
reviews the draft. So the design is only worked
on after the content manager and the executive

19
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:56,574
review the slide post content, the text content,
and then it is sent to the designer for design

20
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:59,835
because the design works takes quite a bit of
time. So we're making sure that everything

21
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:05,578
is good to go before it moves to the design
queue. And once it's designed, it is sent back

22
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:09,759
to the content manager first for review. And
if the content is good to go, they can pass

23
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:14,081
it to the next stage, which is a need executive
approval stage, or if design edits are needed,

24
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:20,764
or the grammatical issues in the design or something
like that, they can assign it back to the graphic

25
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:25,767
designer and they will make the edits in the
design. and then send it to the content manager

26
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:30,693
again for review. And then he can pass it on
to the executive. And if the executive likes

27
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:36,280
it, it moves to the ready to be posted queue
and the ready to be company page queue. So

28
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,606
just as usual, individual steps

29
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:48,840
are covered in here. So it's easy PCA to just
go about it and complete each of the tasks

30
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:57,285
assigned to each of you for each of these sub
tasks. Now let's talk a bit about the ideation

31
00:02:57,305 --> 00:03:02,808
process for slide shares. So most of the slide
posts, slide shares, slide posts will be discussed.

32
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:06,890
The ideas for the slide posts will be discussed
on the content ideation course. But if you

33
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,713
want to come up with ideas, one of the best
places to do this is a website called slideshare.com.

34
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:20,330
Now what slideshare is, is it's a directory
of presentation files that have been uploaded

35
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,054
online. So I was looking for construction and
construction project management. All I would

36
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:31,537
need to do is come in here, search for construction
project management. And okay, there's nothing

37
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:35,000
for construction project management. Okay, there
is stuff for construction project management.

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,203
And then all I need to do is myths of construction
project management. Let's take a look at this

39
00:03:40,283 --> 00:03:45,134
one. So if I take a look at this one, there
will be really good expert content already

40
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:52,076
created for you about the myths of construction
project management. So this is something you

41
00:03:52,096 --> 00:04:02,840
can take and you can add a link to this or you
can also download the slide post to your desktop

42
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:13,245
and you can upload it to the slide post template
card, sorry, the slide post card that you've

43
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:17,989
created. In the outline section, you can attach
the file over there like this. Click on plus,

44
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:22,693
you go down and you click on attachment and
you can upload the file over there so that

45
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:26,997
it can be reviewed on the content edition called
and the executive can share their own suggestions

46
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:33,022
and approvals. Ideally, only get started with
the slide content in the post copy after the

47
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:39,366
executive has approved the idea for the slide
content. In addition to these, you can also

48
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:43,749
use additional ways to search for slide posts.
So you can use guides, you can create guides.

49
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:50,913
So guide to construction risk management. So
I'm just thinking of different keywords that

50
00:04:50,953 --> 00:05:00,319
I can use. So ultimate guide to construction
risk management, complete guide to construction

51
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,481
risk management. So this should have steps in
it or sections in it. So that could be like

52
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:09,940
one slide that I create for this specific topic.

53
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,683
five steps to manage construction press. So
these are five slides and I could create like

54
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:21,188
one slide for each of these with an introduction
slide and a final call to action sites to follow

55
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:27,212
us and so on. So this is how you go about IDing.
It's very easy to ID a slide post because you

56
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:31,375
can use it for listicles, you can use it for
tutorials, you can use it for guides. And guides

57
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:37,719
and tutorials are the best performing type of
content format. You can even cover stories

58
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:41,742
in them because they're very easy to consume
on both mobile as well as desktop. Now, how

59
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:46,947
do you get started with creating your slide
posts? So just like Experiential Stories, we

60
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:51,030
have outlines for slide posts as well. So you
can just come to the IG content marketing modules

61
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,154
workbook. And in there, we have outlines for
slide posts. So you just search for slide post

62
00:05:56,194 --> 00:06:00,959
outlines. And you'll find these five outlines
for slide posts that have already performed

63
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,562
well. So you've taken a slide post that has
went viral. And we've reverse engineered it

64
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:12,504
to give you an outline. So Just take any one
of these outlines that is apt for your idea

65
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:18,485
and just go through each of these lines and
create a line based on each of these lines.

66
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,986
And you'll be good to go. Just as usual, after
you're done with the slide post creation for

67
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:29,248
both the content for these slides as well as
the content for the post copies, you should

68
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:34,369
be going back to hooks because hooks are very
important for making sure your post perform

69
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,478
well. Come back to hooks and optimize the first
two to three lines of both the slide posts.

70
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:44,748
as well as the post copy. You can choose any
of these hooks that's good for the post and

71
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:44,928
optimize it. That brings us to our end of the
slide post video. I'll see you in the next one.
