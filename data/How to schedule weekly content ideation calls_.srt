1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,210
So let's take a look at how to
schedule weekly content ideation

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,529
calls and assign content tasks.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,800
So first, let's talk about what
is the content ideation call.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,049
So the content ideation call is ideally
a weekly call with the content team

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,910
comprising of the executive, the
content manager, and the copywriters

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,055
who are involved in the creation of
the content piece and The content

7
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:27,915
manager will be moderating these calls.

8
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:30,815
So what that means is, they'll
take in charge of the calls,

9
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:33,475
they'll schedule the calls or the
calendars of the team members.

10
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:38,364
They'll set up the call, they make sure
everyone attends and they'll be moderating

11
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:42,224
the call as in leading the call and
directing what to discuss on the call.

12
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:45,225
The content ideation calls
have a specific purpose.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,040
The purpose is to discuss content, review
content generate ideas and discuss ideas

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,890
with the executive and get approvals
on, on existing content pieces that have

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,200
already been created in the previous week.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,259
So The management of the entire content
ideation was done by the content manager,

17
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:07,279
of course but all of the team members
will actively participate in these calls

18
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:11,899
by asking questions to the executive and
the executive is the thought leader who

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,979
has the expertise in the niche expertise
in the content and the knowledge to

20
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,149
create really good content will be
sharing and answering those questions

21
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,389
and sharing their ideas and, and.

22
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,479
thoughts and opinions and their
own experiences and so on on

23
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,599
the content ideation call.

24
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,609
Now there is an ideal structure
for a content ideation call.

25
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:38,149
So this is the structure that has
worked for us over the past few years.

26
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,884
So on every content ideation call,
which is typically at least one hour

27
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:46,154
each, the first 20 minutes will go
towards content review and feedback.

28
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:50,744
The second 20 minutes will go towards
the content manager and the copywriters

29
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:55,524
discussing the ideas they came up
with, with the executive and asking

30
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:59,964
the executive to add more information
and knowledge to that idea or opinion.

31
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:00,975
Say for example.

32
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,069
You come across a new story
about let's take construction

33
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:06,559
as an example niche for this.

34
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:11,139
If you come across a post idea in
construction, say on how construction

35
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,949
is a risky industry, then once the
content copywriter or content manager

36
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,079
adds it to ClickUp as a content idea
these ideas will be discussed with the

37
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:24,179
executive and the executive will share
their own opinions on that specific.

38
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,540
News post on that specific topic of
construction being a risky business, and

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,920
they may share an experience or two, or
they may share their own take on it, and

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
this is what we mean by the interview.

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,130
So for, after each idea is shared in
the next 20 minutes, the second slot

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,679
the content manager and copywriter
can ask questions about that specific

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,594
idea to the executive, and the
executive will share those ideas.

44
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,775
They first approve those
ideas if they're good or not.

45
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,745
If they're bad ideas,
they can reject them.

46
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,035
If they're good ideas, they can
share their opinions on them.

47
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:55,765
And the content manager and the copywriter
will note them down in the cleanup task.

48
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:56,985
We'll explain more about this.

49
00:02:57,365 --> 00:03:01,814
But the last 20 minutes of the content
ideation call are of the executives

50
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,304
sharing their own content ideas.

51
00:03:03,544 --> 00:03:06,844
So this can also include
them sharing their opinions.

52
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,599
on questions asked by the
copywriter and the content manager.

53
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:19,090
But this time will be exclusively
for the executives to share

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,680
their own content pieces.

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,169
And if we have time left the copywriters
and content managers can ask more

56
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,809
questions and continue the second stage.

57
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:30,784
So, let's take a look at what
each of these are in detail.

58
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:35,514
So, but before we get into that,
we need to discuss what happens

59
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,814
before the content addition call.

60
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:40,004
So, before the content addition call,
before every content addition call

61
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:43,854
that happens ideally in a weekly
fashion, the content manager ensures

62
00:03:43,854 --> 00:03:46,994
that at least two content ideas for
each content calendar, content format,

63
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,374
or admin click up and outlines.

64
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:56,119
So, in the content format sheet in the
content analysis, Work spreadsheet.

65
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,459
We've already detailed the content
formats that we'll be using in this cycle.

66
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:05,289
So we can constantly change this and
like add more content formats from

67
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:09,439
the content format queue and test more
formats, but Considering that we are

68
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,279
using these formats to get started with
our content management process or content

69
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:18,379
marketing process These are the content
formats that the content manager should

70
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:25,634
be checking to ensure that they have at
least Two content ideas for each of these

71
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:28,404
content formats So we need to make sure
that we have at least two experiences

72
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:32,994
to these two slide posts to kna video
ideas to informative post ideas And to

73
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:36,284
engage in beta ideas now i'm not talking
about the finished post i'm talking

74
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:39,284
about topic ideas for each of these.

75
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:43,264
We will dive deep into how to ideate
content for experiences stories and

76
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:45,804
for each of these content formats,
in fact for all of these content

77
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:47,744
formats later on in this module.

78
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:51,324
But this is just so that you understand
like what is supposed to be done

79
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:53,804
right before the content ideation
call when you actually go ahead and

80
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:55,064
schedule a content ideation call.

81
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,954
So two content ideas for each of the
content calendar content formats,

82
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:02,244
so these are the content calendar
content formats And they need to

83
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:03,884
be added in ClickUp in outlines.

84
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,714
So they need to create a copy of
the template card, like we discussed

85
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:10,764
earlier, and they need to add it as
in ClickUp in the outline section.

86
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:12,384
It may not be a finished outline.

87
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:15,594
A finished outline will be created
only during the content edition call

88
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:16,994
or after the content ideation call.

89
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,505
But this needs to be done.

90
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,720
Now, It's not necessary that the
content manager creates comes up

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,110
with all these ideas by themselves.

92
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,600
So it's not always it's not the case that
they they need to do the research and come

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,840
up with the ideas They can also ask the
copywriters to come up with ideas So if

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,010
the copywriters you can content manager
can reach out to the copywriters every

95
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,490
week once every week and i'll tell them
that okay You need to come up with three

96
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,280
two post ideas for experience stories
two post ideas for Slight pose and two

97
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,905
post ideas for q and a videos and the
remaining he can either do it himself Or

98
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:51,205
he can assign it to the same copywriter
or assign it to a different copywriter.

99
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:51,725
It's up to him.

100
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,745
So based on your working setup,
the process might change.

101
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:59,115
But the goal is that we ensure that at
least two content ideas for each content

102
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:01,845
format are added in ClickUp and Outlines.

103
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:07,715
Now doing like say the ideation process
is covered in detail later on this module.

104
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:12,205
But let's move on to the first 20
minutes and the ideal structure and,

105
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:14,045
and what we do in the first 20 minutes.

106
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:18,710
Now, During the first 20 minutes
we'll take a few actions.

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,520
So first the content manager will
share their screen, present their

108
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,210
screen on the call, and present
the content pieces in the need

109
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,910
executive approval stage in ClickUp.

110
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,660
So it's in the need of executive
approval that we have the finished

111
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,710
content pieces and all the executive
needs to do is review the, the pieces

112
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,190
and either they can give the feedback.

113
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:40,975
About that content piece if they have any
feedback and they need something revised

114
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:44,945
or edited Or they can straight away say
that this post is approved and it go to

115
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:50,415
the approval queue now So what the content
manager will do is content manager will

116
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:55,355
either update the status of that content
piece So if it's approved, of course, it

117
00:06:55,355 --> 00:07:00,335
will go to the next queue in the process,
which is the ready to be posted queue but

118
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:04,105
if it is not approved it will go to the
previous stage in the process, which is

119
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:08,735
Drafts so that the copywriter can edit
that content piece again and then send

120
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,665
it again to the copywriter for reviewing.

121
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,445
So the content manager for reviewing.

122
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,825
So these are the three steps
that the content manager will

123
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:19,625
take during the first 20 minutes
because it is for content review.

124
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:24,525
So ideally The content reviewing should be
done on the content ideation calls itself.

125
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,845
So a lot of executives because they
like to sit and think through about

126
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:32,795
before they approve a piece of content
they will recommend that this can

127
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:35,745
be done after the call, so that the
call can just be used for meetings.

128
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:39,225
But the purpose of the content edition
call is not just to communicate.

129
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,310
The different tasks that were done and
the different tasks that are to be done.

130
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,870
The purpose of the content addition
call is also to give the copywriters as

131
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,420
well as the content manager a very good
idea about what the executive prefers.

132
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,920
Because not all of this content will
be published on the company pages.

133
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,960
They can also be published
on the user profiles.

134
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:03,360
And many of these posts will have to
include the personality and tone of

135
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,290
voice of the Executive so ideally the
reviewing and the feedback needs to

136
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,460
be given on the call itself so that
the content manager and copywriter can

137
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,920
live ask questions and understand more
about the tone of voice and the type of

138
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,209
content formats and the type of writing
that the that the executive prefers.

139
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,150
So this feedback has to be live on
the call itself and not later on.

140
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,000
So as much as possible, the content
manager will make sure that the

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,520
executive will give the feedback on
the calls itself, give approvals and

142
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,430
review the posts on the calls itself.

143
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,900
And they will facilitate this
by sharing their screen and

144
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,070
going through each click up.

145
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:49,065
task that is ready in
the EX Approval stage.

146
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:50,885
So that's the Executive Approval stage.

147
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,475
They'll go through each of those
ClickUp tasks, they'll share the screen,

148
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:56,425
they'll walk them through the post
and they'll make sure it's approved.

149
00:08:56,845 --> 00:09:01,795
Now once, I'll straight away show
you how to do this in ClickUp.

150
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:05,205
So, here is a ClickUp post example.

151
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:10,335
So this is a slide post that is
in the need executive approval.

152
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,055
So we have the outline, we have the
slide content already created, we

153
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:17,615
have the post copy added in here, and
we also have the slide that has been

154
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:23,124
designed by the design team and this
is ready for the executive's approval.

155
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:27,600
So what the content manager will do
in the review process is first they

156
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,160
will share their screen and present
this piece they'll walk them through

157
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,870
walk the executive through the slide
content and then the post copy and

158
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,150
then the designed post and how it
looks like and if everything is

159
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,985
good to go then the Content manager
will move it to the approved queue.

160
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,855
So the approved queue after need executive
approval will be ready to be posted on

161
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,885
the user profile and the company page.

162
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:55,865
So they can move it to the queue,
but if the executive has any feedback

163
00:09:55,865 --> 00:10:01,575
on it, they can drop a comment
to tagging the, the copywriter.

164
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:03,185
So assume this is the copywriter.

165
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,795
This is me, but assume it's a copywriter.

166
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:06,255
And you'll see here's...

167
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,585
Feedback for edits.

168
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:10,535
All right.

169
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:12,825
And they can just mentioned
like a bulleted list of

170
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:16,500
change a Change B and so on.

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,980
So that the copywriter can go ahead and
make the changes and then commented.

172
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,100
And then after that, what the copywriter
will will do, the content manager will

173
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,280
do, is take a look at the subtasks.

174
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,430
So in the subtasks they can see
that all these tasks still, the

175
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,310
content managers the executives
approval has been completed.

176
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,420
So it's in this stage right now, but
since the, we need edits in this.

177
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,120
This has to be reverted back to the
drafts queue or if the edits are design

178
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,150
suggestions, it can be done in this queue.

179
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,080
So he will have to move it, this back
to assigned and this back to assigned.

180
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,020
So that moves back to that stage.

181
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,150
And then he'll move it back to a
waiting media file, which is the stage.

182
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,670
So it's really simple.

183
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,510
We just move it back to two queues
so that the design can be edited.

184
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:06,195
By the designer who's working on it.

185
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,655
So that sums up this step.

186
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:12,385
And finally, the updated status
and note the feedback in the

187
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,455
ClickUp Tasks requirement,
which they've already done here.

188
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,615
And that should be it.

189
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:22,115
Now, the second step in the content
addition call is when Content

190
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:26,055
manager and the copywriter will
suggest ideas, will present the

191
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:27,425
ideas that they've come up with.

192
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:31,105
So, some of the content formats
have to be ideated only on the

193
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:35,075
calls by the copywriters and content
managers, ideating, say, experiential

194
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,005
stories with the executive.

195
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:40,805
But some content formats, like especially
the viral content formats, almost all

196
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:46,195
the viral content formats in Viral
Newsguy and, Viral influencer personas

197
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:49,385
can all be created before the call.

198
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,555
So right before the call, they can
come up with the ideas of, they don't

199
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:55,935
need like a lot of input from the
executive for each of these ideas.

200
00:11:56,165 --> 00:12:00,735
They just need to be reviewed by
the executive and feedback given on

201
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,045
whether that's a good idea or not.

202
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:06,085
Again, this is not a content like
fully created content piece reviewer.

203
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:10,085
So that was this, this first minute,
20 minutes of the call is only for

204
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,805
content that is ready to be approved.

205
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:14,195
So it's fully created.

206
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:20,369
This is simply for the ideas
that the content manager and the

207
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:21,599
copywriter have come up with.

208
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:24,309
So all of these ideas will
be present in the outlines.

209
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:27,449
So the content manager makes sure
that two ideas for each of the content

210
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:31,079
formats in the content calendar
have been added in the outline stage

211
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,339
before the content edition call.

212
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:36,009
So on the call they will come in
and they will share their screen

213
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:36,769
and present these content ideas.

214
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,070
In the outline stage in ClickUp and
the executive just needs to review

215
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,529
the ideas and, and be interviewed by
the content manager and copywriter.

216
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,909
So if it's a simple idea, like, okay,
here's a news idea about this particular

217
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,689
topic what are your thoughts about this?

218
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,939
What is your opinion about this?

219
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:57,139
So the executive will share their own
opinions and share their own thought

220
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:02,159
leadership and take on that specific
topic and the content manager adds

221
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,259
notes and feedback in the ClickUp task
in comments as a comment, just like

222
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,059
we did during the first 20 minutes
so that this idea can be worked on.

223
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,009
Now.

224
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:18,834
In after this step, after the next,
this 20 minutes, the next 20 minutes is

225
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:21,164
exclusively for Executives Content Ideas.

226
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:26,124
Now the executive will have a bunch of
topics that he or she wishes to share or

227
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,784
talk about on the Content ideation call.

228
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,804
And this part of the call
is specifically for that.

229
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,894
So they'll share the topics or ideas.

230
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:38,824
They want the content team to generate
content on both the content manager

231
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:42,314
and copywriters will interview
ask more questions so that the

232
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:46,504
executive can dive deeper into
that specific idea they suggest and

233
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,514
get more details of those ideas.

234
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:49,094
So the.

235
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,419
The role of the executive is
to share and answer questions.

236
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:56,969
And the role of the content managers
here at this step is to ask more

237
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,549
questions, more broad questions.

238
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:01,709
So they understand a lot more
about the ideas that are being

239
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:02,859
shared by the executives.

240
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:06,739
Now, the content manager will direct
the conversation towards our content

241
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,469
formats where ideation is still pending.

242
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:12,599
So in this section itself the content
managers should take a look at the content

243
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,849
filter, ensure that all the content.

244
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:18,149
The ideation for the content
formats listed in the content

245
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,629
format sheet have been completed.

246
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,889
If more ideas are needed in that area,
the content manager will direct the

247
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:28,069
conversation towards those content formats
where the ideation is still pending.

248
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:33,919
And whenever like an idea is shared
by the executive or a feedback

249
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,179
is given by the executive or, or
experiences are shared by the executor

250
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:39,939
for say an experiential story.

251
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:42,909
The content manager will create
new content tasks from the template

252
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:46,509
cards for the respective content
format that the ideas are for.

253
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,709
So if an experiential story is
being shared, they'll make a

254
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,289
copy of the experiential story.

255
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:55,324
template card template task and
add the idea in the outline section

256
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:58,574
and update the parent task status
as outlines in the ClickUp task.

257
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:02,744
So by default, whenever you create a
copy or duplicate the template card,

258
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:04,444
the status will be template itself.

259
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:08,074
So that has to be changed to the
outline skew so that now we know

260
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,984
that an outline has to be created.

261
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,439
For that specific idea.

262
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:14,739
So this is the structure of
the content edition calls.

263
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,819
The first 20 minutes of review and
feedback of content that is already

264
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:25,469
created the next 20 minutes of the
executive reviewing and approving and

265
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:30,349
giving feedback on ideas shared by the
content manager and copywriter and the

266
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:34,869
next 20 minutes of executing sharing
topics that they want to talk about.

267
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,614
Plus the content manager also making sure
that all the content formats that are in

268
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:41,694
the content calendar have been ideated.

269
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:46,924
Now let's take a look at what happens
after the content reduction call

270
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:50,294
because this is where most of the
assigning of the content tasks happens.

271
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:53,664
So the content manager first reviews
the content calendar and ensures that

272
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:57,494
two content pieces for each content
task have been assigned for the content

273
00:15:57,494 --> 00:15:58,754
formats in the content calendar.

274
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:03,359
So if we take a look at the content
calendar, you can see that we have

275
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:08,319
five content formats at all times
scheduled for like Mondays to Fridays

276
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:09,729
because we are posting every day.

277
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,419
So why are we scheduling, why
are we assigning two posts for

278
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,789
each of these content formats?

279
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:16,989
So here's the reason.

280
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,984
You need to build up a buffer of content.

281
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:23,224
You need to build up a, a database
of content that has already been

282
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:26,794
created, reviewed, and approved
over time as you continue with

283
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:27,994
the content marketing process.

284
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,934
Now, the only way to do this is
to create content in advance.

285
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:33,964
So even if you only create need
to create like five posts per

286
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:35,974
week, create 10 posts per week.

287
00:16:35,974 --> 00:16:39,504
So make sure that you have five piece
content pieces in advanced that the

288
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:42,204
team has already worked on that is
ready to go live and approved by the.

289
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,229
by the executive so that
they can be published.

290
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:49,199
Now over time this will help you a lot
because if you have like one month of

291
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,029
content that has already been created
in advance, even if you miss a content

292
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:58,469
ideation call or two because of a vacation
or because of the executive being busy.

293
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,639
This won't be an issue later
on, but the executive could be

294
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,349
busy at, at some point of time.

295
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:06,619
They tend to be busy and a content
edition caller too could get skipped.

296
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:12,419
So it's, it's always a good idea to
always assign two content, two content

297
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,429
pieces to the copywriters for each content
format that is in the content calendar.

298
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:19,169
All right.

299
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,169
Now the, the content manager will
also direct the copywriters to

300
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:27,059
add two content ideas for each
content format for the next call.

301
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,299
So for the call that happens on the next
week, the content ideation call, the

302
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:34,849
content manager will also suggest the
content ideas that has to be created.

303
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:37,269
So they can assign it accordingly
and they can tell them, okay,

304
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,249
these are the content formats.

305
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,449
I'd like you to come up with two
content ideas for each of these content

306
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:45,289
formats that are to be discussed on
the next week's content addition call.

307
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,059
So that the ideation is also progressing
parallelly for the next batch of

308
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,509
content for the next week's cycle.

309
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:58,614
Let's also take a quick look at what
happens during the ideation process.

310
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:03,704
So this typically happens during the
second 20 minute batch of content

311
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:09,884
ideation where the, the content
manager and copywriter will suggest

312
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:13,614
ideas to the executive and the
executive will, will approve those

313
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:17,934
ideas and give feedback on those
ideas or reject those ideas overwrite.

314
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,534
So let's take a look at IDEAP.

315
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:23,509
This is an idea of a post on
why is the construction industry

316
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:26,619
becoming Canada's pain and we
have an a draft of an outlines.

317
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:30,219
The outline is not complete yet because
the executive has not approved it.

318
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,639
So this has just been added by your
content manager or copywriter in here.

319
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:36,619
And after this idea is discussed.

320
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:40,274
The content manager has to make
notes on the call itself, ideally,

321
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:45,594
on like additional things to be
included in the, in the slide post.

322
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:48,684
So for example, add graphs and
comment on data and graphs and

323
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:51,114
also include the quote from the
founders mentioned in the article.

324
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:56,064
So this, these kinds of comments
are added after the article or the

325
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:59,174
source of the news is discussed
on the content ideation call.

326
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:00,854
So the executive will
share their feedback.

327
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:02,424
So the feedback has to be noted in here.

328
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,044
And once that is done.

329
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:05,714
This can be moved to draft.

330
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:09,014
So once the outline is completed
the content manager can go ahead

331
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,144
and assign it to the copywriter
that will be working on it.

332
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:17,245
And this will be moved to the next
stage regarding the assigning because

333
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:20,444
this is the launch of the content
management process for this specific card.

334
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:23,195
They just need to follow the
checklist for each of the subtasks.

335
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,055
So here are the checklist
for each of the subtasks.

336
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:28,605
So these are all the things to
be done for the outline step.

337
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,779
And later on in the module we're
covering how to do this for each

338
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,600
content format in a dedicated video,
so you just need to follow that.

339
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:39,189
But this is what happens during the
second 20 minutes of the content

340
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:43,989
ideation call, just so you get an idea
on how the outlines creation happens.

341
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:48,109
Now, let's take a look at some
other important things about

342
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:49,149
the content ideation calls.

343
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,959
So all content ideation calls should
be recorded as well as transcribed.

344
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:56,559
This is important because the
copywriters as well as the content

345
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:01,189
managers will always need to refer
these to understand what the.

346
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:02,809
Executive is shared.

347
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,839
So a lot of content is discussed
and a lot of experiences are shared.

348
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:09,809
A lot of opinions are given
by the executives on a one

349
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:10,789
hour content addition call.

350
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,509
So it's very difficult to note
it all down in like one go.

351
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:17,769
So it's important that the calls
are recorded as well as transcribed.

352
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,504
The reason transcription is important
is because the copywriters will

353
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:26,074
often be copying the transcription
and then starting to work on the

354
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:29,914
script or the post copy from what
was discussed in the transcriptions.

355
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:33,234
That's the easiest way for them
to go ahead and create start

356
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:34,284
creating a piece of content.

357
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:39,024
So for recordings you can use like any
platforms that you can using for meetings

358
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:40,884
like Google Meet teams, zoom, WebEx.

359
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:42,904
All of these meet platforms can be used.

360
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:45,664
All of them offer inbuilt
recording features.

361
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:49,754
You can also use additional tools
like meeting recording tools like

362
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:53,664
Fireflies and one of the interesting
features of Fireflies is that it

363
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:55,234
also has a transcription feature.

364
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:59,354
So Fireflies will automatically record
as long as Fireflies is synced to

365
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:01,644
your Gmail account or Outlook account.

366
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:04,109
It will automatically join the calls.

367
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,729
It will automatically record the calls
and transcribe the calls as well.

368
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:12,069
And it will also automatically send
the transcriptions and the link

369
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:15,609
to the recordings to all the team
members that attended those calls.

370
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,969
So it's a very useful
tool if you'd like to.

371
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,204
Record calls.

372
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:23,564
So this is the setup that I would
recommend for recording and transcribing

373
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:24,674
your content ideation calls.

374
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:28,804
Now, I'd also like to touch a bit
about the content manager's role

375
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:30,584
on the content ideation calls.

376
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:35,334
Now, since the content manager will be
the primary moderator of these content

377
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:38,534
edition calls they have to make sure
that they actively promote discussion.

378
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:42,579
By asking a lot of questions to the
executive, interviewing them properly

379
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:45,849
so that you get the most out of their
thought leadership, that get the

380
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:49,929
most out of their expertise in the
specific industry and niche and hold

381
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,879
the other team members accountable
as well for active participation.

382
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,879
So often what happens is the
content manager, if one person

383
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,299
takes a needle, they call the other.

384
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,129
People will just mute and stay silent.

385
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,379
They won't actively
participate and ask questions.

386
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,839
So this is a complete no no
for content ideation calls.

387
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:08,699
All the copywriters and other parties,
other members attending these calls have

388
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:13,329
to actively participate, share their
ideas, discuss opinions ask more questions

389
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:17,879
to the executive so that the executive
can, can share as much as possible about.

390
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,599
different angles about
that, that content topic.

391
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,979
Now this is a constant activity,
so the content manager has

392
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:26,499
to constantly encourage the
copywriters to ask more questions,

393
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:27,839
otherwise they just stay dormant.

394
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,779
And then just mute yourself
and just listen to the calls.

395
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,349
That is not the ideal scenario.

396
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:36,109
The copywriters need to actively
participate and ask questions so that

397
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:39,819
they can understand everything about
that content format from the executive.

398
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,709
Now often like whenever in like
technical content topics or like a very

399
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:48,659
specific content topic is discussed
the executive will mention that

400
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,249
they want to share reference links.

401
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,139
And from our experience if you put off
like sharing the reference links later on.

402
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:58,249
This will cause a constant source
of delays, irrespective of how

403
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,189
productive or timely the executive is.

404
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:05,329
So make sure that the all the reference
links are shared on the call itself

405
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,899
in the chat, and then the content
manager can just copy, copy the

406
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:12,959
links from the chat and add them to
the ClickUp task on the call itself.

407
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,319
So it's, it's best not to
put this off for later.

408
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,379
And that is a tip from my experience.

409
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:26,549
So that sums up the video on
how to create, how to schedule

410
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:30,209
weekly content ideation calls and
how to assign tasks efficiently.

411
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:34,239
If you have any questions at all, please
feel free to drop them in the community

412
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:37,179
or ask us to them on the coaching calls.

413
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:41,109
But the content ideation calls are the
foundation of creation, creating really

414
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:45,399
good content, because it's only if the
executive who has the thought leadership

415
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:47,059
and expertise in a, in that specific.

416
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:48,174
industry and topic.

417
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:51,424
They need to be able to
share really good content.

418
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:54,564
So you need to be approaching
them for getting really good

419
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:55,564
content ideas from them.

420
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:58,954
And at the same time you need
to be actively participating in

421
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:01,764
these content ideation calls to
get the most out of these calls.

422
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,614
So with that off that's it for this video.

423
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,574
I'll see you in the next video.
