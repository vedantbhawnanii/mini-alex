1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,220
And LinkBoost requires you to pay 

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,320
right at the start, 

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,920
so I think the plans 

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,480
vary 

5
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,240
from free stuff to premium to plus 

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
the free stuff is not enough 

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,940
because we'll be posting every single day ideally 

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,000
so you can start off with the premium plan 

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,960
and the premium plan is straight in an USD amount 

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,140
and you can post 

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,180
one post every single day of the month. 

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,660
Alright, so 

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,280
let's move on 

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,300
to LinkBoost and why we use LinkBoost 

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,360
so let me give you a quick introduction 

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,680
into LinkedIn content promotion and why it's essential 

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,160
to 

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,820
gain traction with content marketing on LinkedIn first. 

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,600
Now, 

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,760
whenever you post a piece of content on LinkedIn, 

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,660
LinkedIn does not automatically or immediately 

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,240
show it to all of your connections and your followers, 

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,260
but rather it shows it to 

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,400
a small percentage 

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,380
of your connections and your followers. 

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
So if you post a piece of content and you get, say 

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,240
one like and one comment in the first 2 hours, 

28
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,739
2 or 3 hours of posting, 

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,680
LinkedIn will immediately assume the algorithm 

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,100
will immediately assume 

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,040
that 

32
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,080
the piece of content is not engaging enough, 

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,020
which is why it's not generating a lot of engagement. 

34
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,440
But if you post something 

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,960
and you are able to generate 

36
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,720
dozens of likes and dozens of 

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,900
comments in the first few hours of posting, 

38
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,840
that is a signal to the algorithm that the post is very 

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,320
engaging, so it opens up 

40
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,800
the reach of. 

41
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,900
The post to a larger percentage 

42
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,780
of your First degree, Second degree 

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,180
and Third degree connections and your followers. 

44
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,740
This is what we are trying to do 

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,580
with content promotion tools like LinkBoost. 

46
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,480
We will deep dive 

47
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,120
into 

48
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,300
content promotion later onto the program, 

49
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,600
but for the time being 

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,080
all you need to do is sign up to be time to LinkBoost. 

51
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,380
I suggest using the premium plan. 

52
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,780
The premium plan 

53
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,020
will allow you 

54
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,720
to publish one post every day 

55
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,860
so that should be more than enough for now. 

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,200
It's 29 USD a month, 

57
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,300
just sign up for it 

58
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,440
and it works exactly the same 

59
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,160
way like Taplio 

60
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,860
so you will have to install a chrome extension 

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
to use LinkBoost 

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,539
and connect to your LinkedIn account, 

63
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,380
but it's pretty simple to set up, 

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,020
but after you've done with 

65
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,660
setting a linkboost 

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,240
every day, what I want you to do is take a look at 

67
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,500
the Queue

68
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,280
and the time zone that you've set up in Taplio. 

69
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,800
So in my case 

70
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,820
I've set up 

71
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,800
the post to go live at 8 am my time from Taplio, 

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,620
so every day 8 am 

73
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,900
opposed those life. 

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,160
Now 

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,780
what I will do is I will set up a reminder or an alarm 

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,920
in my calendar or in my phone 

77
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,200
reminding me to engage of the post. 

78
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,860
Now this is important. 

79
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,060
You can just choose to publish 

80
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,140
from Taplio and not engage, 

81
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,860
but you will always get the best results 

82
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,420
if you promote the boost using LinkBoost 

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,540
and you manually respond to all the comments, 

84
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,040
so assume this will take approximately 

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,500
30 minutes of your time 

86
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
on all the days. 

87
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,960
On all the working days that you're publishing 

88
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,820
and this has to be done manually. 

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,720
You can choose 

90
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,920
just automate the whole thing, 

91
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,120
automate the publishing 

92
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,860
and just not promote and not engage with the content, 

93
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,860
but that will affect your reach 

94
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,460
and I wouldn't recommend it. 

95
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,280
But once I've set an alarm, 

96
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,420
all I will do is every day when I log into 

97
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,000
LinkedIn I will log into LinkedIn 

98
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,720
I will copy the link to the post. 

99
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,400
So for example, 

100
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,340
if this is the post that I've just published, 

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,160
I will just copy a link to the post, 

102
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,020
so this is a link to the post I will come 

103
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,140
into LinkBoost, 

104
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,140
I will click on 

105
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,860
posts 

106
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,260
and I will add a new post. 

107
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,260
So this is the daily process that you need to follow, 

108
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,280
but let me walk you through the entire process 

109
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,880
step by step on how to set up 

110
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,980
LinkBoost first 

111
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,340
for optimal 

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,480
reach of your content. 

113
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,700
So let's take a look at how to find 

114
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,360
the right communities of pods in LinkBoost. 

115
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,240
So think of pods as communities, 

116
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,160
small communities, 

117
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,560
or groups of contemporators on LinkedIn 

118
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,880
who are trying to build engagement on each 

119
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,840
other's content 

120
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,260
that they publish on LinkedIn. 

121
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,040
So 

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,120
rather than find 

123
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,280
relevant pods on specific topics or relevant pods on 

124
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
specific locations like Brazil. 

125
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,240
For example, just focus on joining the biggest pods. 

126
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,760
I will explain how to filter them by location, 

127
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,440
which is the main filter that matters 

128
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,580
when we schedule and publish the content, 

129
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
or for the time being 

130
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,360
just focus on finding really big pods and joining them. 

131
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,960
So all you need to do to join big pods 

132
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,520
is click on join pod 

133
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,320
in here 

134
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,560
and Link

135
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,600
Boost will send a request 

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,640
to the pod that meant to join the pod 

137
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,980
so I keep doing this 

138
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,980
until I send out requests to as many pods as possible. 

139
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,380
I'm going to keep doing those German 

140
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,700
so there's a bunch of them in here' 

141
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,380
all of these are pillow hundred users so I'm not very 

142
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,900
interested in joining parts below hundred users 

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,200
because LinkBoost has some parts that have 

144
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,240
already have hundreds of users. 

145
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,140
I've already joined a lot of them 

146
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,020
so you can find like 

147
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,660
the biggest parts on LinkBoost in here already. So 

148
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,800
just 

149
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,000
search for these names. I'd scroll through this list. 

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,340
Just search for these names in your own LinkBoost 

151
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,500
when you're doing this 

152
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,960
and you should be able to find the biggest pods. 

153
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,280
So you have the Growth Hacking Pod.

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,420
but yeah we have 

186
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,060
the biggest pods in here, 

187
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,220
so just join these pods and you're done. 

188
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,060
And the next step after this 

189
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,780
after you've joined 

190
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,020
all these pods is to wait for a day 

191
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,900
now. The reason we wait is 

192
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,100
to give time 

193
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,180
for the admins to approve 

194
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,020
our request to join these pods. 

195
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,880
That's all you need to do, and once you've done that' 

196
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,980
all you need to do is come back. 

197
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,580
The posts page in here and this is where you 

198
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
schedule posts, 

199
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,420
so all you need to do is first click on 

200
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,120
new posts 

201
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,880
so you just click on new posts in here 

202
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,660
and it will open up a new page 

203
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,960
which is where you can add the link 

204
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,500
to your LinkedIn post. 

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,100
So every day after you set a reminder 

206
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,800
based on when you're publishing 

207
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,860
See 8 AM 

208
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,580
on the 10, all I need to do 

209
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,880
is 

210
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,740
set a reminder 

211
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,060
come in here 

212
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,760
go to my LinkedIn account, 

213
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,280
get the link to the post that was just published, 

214
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,260
so I'm going to take copy link to that post 

215
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,640
and I'm going to come to 

216
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,120
LinkBoosts. 

217
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,760
I'm going to 

218
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,100
copy paste that URLto the post in here 

219
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,420
and then all I need to do is select the pods. Now 

220
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,000
if you want unique engagement 

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
every single time you post, 

222
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
you can choose to select 

223
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,240
some specific pods in here, 

224
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,160
but if you want to 

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,800
maximize the engagement on every single post, 

226
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,780
all you need to do is 

227
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,380
auto select the pods and 

228
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,360
LinkBoost will automatically select 

229
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,740
the biggest pods 

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,260
that you can publish from 

231
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,880
automatically. 

232
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,480
So the next step after that is to add the comments 

233
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,220
and again in here we are going to use ChatGPT

234
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,000
So now we're going to go to ChatGPT and create 

235
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,420
some personalized comments for this post 

236
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,860
and we're going to add them in here. 

237
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,320
So let me show you how to do that in ChatGPT. 

238
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,200
The first step is creating the prompt 

239
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,540
or adding the prompt 

240
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,180
for creating the personalized comments, 

241
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,640
so this is the prompt in ChatGPT. 

242
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,500
I need to click on New chat 

243
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,539
and post this 

244
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,240
prompt and the postcopy 

245
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
out right? So the prompt goes like the 

246
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,299
Prepare 30 comments for this LinkedIn post by 

247
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,600
add your name over here, 

248
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,700
so whatever your name is added over here, 

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm here as some rules 

250
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,760
I'd like you. To follow the comment should 33 

251
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
questions, some funny comments, 

252
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,900
some positives, some negative and neutral comments. 

253
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,800
The comment should be unique 

254
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,880
and the length should vary in 

255
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,120
between 5 words and 15 modes. 

256
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,400
Add emojis in 5 comments and only in 5 comments 

257
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,420
here are supposed 

258
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,180
and then from LinkedIn you can simply copy paste the 

259
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,300
post copy 

260
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,240
that you want to create the comments for, so 

261
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,460
all I need to do is just 

262
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,340
copy paste this and paste it over here and 

263
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,740
enter hit. Enter to charge a video with this prompt 

264
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,100
and ChatGPT will create the comments for you 

265
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,540
see how simple is that 

266
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,280
and some of them will 

267
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,700
also have questions so that you can respond 

268
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,260
with your reply to the comments 

269
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,520
so it makes it very easy. 

270
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,080
So all you need to do now is just copy, 

271
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,820
paste all the comments from here, 

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,860
go to linkboost and paste them in here like this. 

273
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,540
That's it. And now you can go back 

274
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,380
and now we need to select the 

275
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,060
type of engagement that we need. 

276
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,580
I really select normal engagement, 

277
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,800
set the random interval between 10 to 20 seconds. 

278
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,900
That is the best way 

279
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,820
and now you need to decide 

280
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,600
the type of audience that you want to engage 

281
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,580
on your content. 

282
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,380
Ideally, what I would recommend is 

283
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,100
selecting Custom Audience 

284
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,540
and click on, Unselect All, click on Unselect All 

285
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,820
and select type of selection and select locations 

286
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,920
from where you want your 

287
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,040
Engagement to come in 

288
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
when you click on any of these locations. 

289
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,900
For example, I am selecting Canada, 

290
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,520
which is the location that we want. 

291
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,540
Engagement from. 

292
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,980
Linkboost will automatically show 

293
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,560
the number of people 

294
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
among all the users that will engage. 

295
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,380
So 61 users from 

296
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,100
all the pods, the members 

297
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,380
that we're a part of that you selected over here 

298
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,680
are from Canada 

299
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:27,960
and now 

300
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,180
we can go ahead and select additional countries. 

301
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,840
I can select Finland, France, 

302
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,500
Germany, like which all countries that I feel the 

303
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,180
engagement will be irrelevant from 

304
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,840
and 

305
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,400
whatever you 

306
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,540
get is the total number of users that will engage 

307
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,580
on my content so that's about 

308
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,460
1482 users 

309
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,800
could engage on my content. 

310
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,420
So after I've selected this 

311
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,740
I can go ahead and 

312
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,240
click on Create new post and Link

313
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,040
Boost will start engaging 

314
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,840
on the post and start getting you likes and 

315
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,520
comments on the post. 

316
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,360
So that's it, 

317
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,340
and this is the activity that you should be doing 

318
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,160
Ideally every day after you see the reminder 

319
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,800
that you posted online you can come in here. 

320
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,420
Copy paste the link to the post. 

321
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,560
Basically we hear 

322
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,760
auto select pods are individually select pods 

323
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,880
if you want unique engagement on every single post 

324
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,080
you do so you can select this pod for one day, 

325
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,160
this pod for the next day, 

326
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,000
this pod for the 

327
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
3rd day and so on. 

328
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,880
I select these 2 pods for one day, 

329
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,840
these 2 pods for the 

330
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,980
second day and so on 

331
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,820
but you need to make sure that the number of users 

332
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,840
that will be engaging on your content 

333
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,080
are atleast a thousand, 

334
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,920
otherwise you will not get a lot of engagement. 

335
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,900
So make sure this number is at least a thousand 

336
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,660
and you are good to go 

337
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,600
use linkboost to promote all your content, 

338
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,620
get likes and comments automatically, 

339
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,560
and that sums up 

340
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,880
our video 

341
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,300
on how to use 

342
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,940
Taplio, ChatGPT

343
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,620
and LinkBoost to automatically or quickly 

344
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,100
create content. 

345
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
So research on content 

346
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,640
find good content topics 

347
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,220
and content pieces that are performed well in the past. 

348
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,260
How to realize them using ChatGPT very quickly 

349
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,800
schedule them in Ta

350
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,840
plio so that they go like automatically 

351
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,680
and schedule 15 

352
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,640
days worth of content, 

353
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,540
so that's 15 working days and 15 posts of content 

354
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,460
and then set their reminder 

355
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,720
in your calendar 

356
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,020
or on your phone to 

357
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,960
remind you to engage 

358
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,160
and promote the content using LinkBoost. 

359
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,680
This cannot be done automatically, 

360
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,120
so if you want to promote it actively 

361
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,880
at this centerpiece, 

362
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,960
you will have to do it manually. 

363
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,980
Using LinkBoost. 

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,060
We discuss how to set up LinkBoost 

365
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,780
and then promote each piece of content using LinkBoost 

366
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,900
and create AI generated comments, and then 

367
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,300
the next step after this is obviously 

368
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,780
to go to the post, 

369
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,380
go to the linked post 

370
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,080
and go to the comment section and respond to each 

371
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,960
other comments 

372
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
that have come in, 

373
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,180
which can. Either be 

374
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,760
a pod comment 

375
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,980
or it can be 

376
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,720
a non LinkBoost non pod comment. 

377
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,880
It can be a genuine comment, 

378
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,320
so 

379
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,740
either way you spend at least 30 minutes 

380
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,840
after you publish the post. 

381
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,180
After you promote the post to come in here and respond 

382
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,320
to 

383
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,560
each of the comments and replay to each of the comments 

384
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,900
but that sums up our process 

385
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,800
and 

386
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,280
the kick starting 

387
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,880
your 

388
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,780
LinkedIn content module.
