00:00:01,398 --> 00:00:07,519
In this video, we will be discussing Engagement
Baits. Now, Engagement Baits is one of the

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,161
easiest content formats that you can use to
quickly generate engagement. There are a few

3
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:17,762
things that you can use in this content format.
The first one is that you need to have some

4
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:22,963
engagement coming in consistently on your content
on LinkedIn for this content format to be really

5
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:28,145
effective, but feel free to include it in your
content formats and the content formats that

6
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:34,751
you're using every week. Let's take a look at
what this content format is first. All you

7
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:44,733
do with Engagement Baits is call up a bunch of
roles of viewers who will be reading your post

8
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:49,675
and get them to engage on your content. This
engagement can come in the form of comments,

9
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:56,397
likes, or shares. What we've done is we've included
a couple Engagement Baits outlines in the Content

10
00:00:56,417 --> 00:01:04,379
Marketing Modules Workbook. And in here you can
find very easy outlines that you can use to

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,081
create posts or Engagement Baits of your own.
So I'm going to go through a couple of them

12
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:13,763
just so you understand how this works. So in
here, say we have, hey, and then we call out

13
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:18,325
a specific niche role. So community member name.
So we can say fitness founders, for example,

14
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:22,047
if your fitness founders are your niche, are
your target audience, and they can say, come

15
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:27,049
in below with your favorite workout. All right.
And a bunch of people will come in below that

16
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:36,691
will increase the reach of the post. and it
will help you. get your content in front of

17
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:42,033
the connections of these folks, the fitness
founders who come in below the post, thereby

18
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:47,396
getting you more targeted reach on the content.
All right, so it's very similar to resource

19
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:51,617
giveaways, but the advantage with Engagement
Baits is that it's very easy to create. So

20
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:55,119
they're very short, because you don't need to
create very big post copies. You just need

21
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,701
to quickly think of what you can, what would
be an interesting topic or what would be an

22
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:05,604
interesting question that you can ask them
and get them to come into that. Let's go through

23
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:10,188
some of the other outlines. You may have seen
follow-drains a lot on several social media

24
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:15,152
platforms. It used to be very active, very common
on LinkedIn like a couple of years ago. But

25
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:22,879
what we do over here is we just ask people to
drop their LinkedIn profile URL so that they

26
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,954
can connect with each other, find more people.
This doesn't work really well if you do it

27
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:35,056
in a generic fashion, but if you say something
along the lines of, hey marketers or hey construction

28
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:40,937
engineers or hey logistics managers and so on,
if your audience on LinkedIn or your first

29
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:46,579
degree network on LinkedIn has a bunch of these
folks, you could get a bunch of people commenting.

30
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,040
As long as you're getting that traction for
these posts, at least 10 people commenting

31
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,161
on these posts, more and more people will see
these posts and you'll keep getting engagement

32
00:02:55,201 --> 00:03:02,174
over time. You can also look at the Engagement
Baits by allowing them or giving them a platform

33
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:06,116
to promote their own products or services. You
could say something like, what are you selling?

34
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:11,060
Drop it in the comments below. This is something
that I've experimented with myself and it's

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,024
worked really well. This is another Engagement
Bait outline that you can experiment with.

36
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:22,648
Here's another one. What can you give the niche?
For example, in my case, I would say marketing

37
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:26,923
or LinkedIn growth marketing or content marketing
and so on. In your case, you could say content

38
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:34,108
construction, or you could say fitness, or you
could say logistics, and so on, or the SaaS

39
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:41,034
community, or AI community for free. Drop it
in the comments below. All right, and finally,

40
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:45,277
we have one more outline over here. I won't
get into that, but it's one of the easiest

41
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:50,462
content formats that you can quickly create
simply by filling out these personalization

42
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:55,890
fields or brackets. Just fill them out, copy
paste into LinkedIn and publish them. You could

43
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,054
promote these with LinkBoost as well to get
some initial traction. But as long as you have

44
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:06,218
10 organic, genuine comments coming in, the
post will generate quite a bit of reach with

45
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:10,922
more people engaging and commenting on the post.
Now that we've gotten an understanding of how

46
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:15,166
this works and how we can get started with it,
let's take a look at the process. So the process

47
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:20,610
is outlined very clearly in ClickUp. The content
manager first creates an outline. This step

48
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,393
is not really needed, but again, we follow a
structured process for all the content formats.

49
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,432
So the content manager starts with the outline.
We can mention the post topic in task typing.

50
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:34,635
And then he assigns all the tasks. And the copywriter
will start with the post copy, which is very

51
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:39,498
short. This is an optional step, adding the
hashtags. You don't really need hashtags for

52
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:44,280
most Engagement Baits. You could include them
though. It's always a good practice to include

53
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,563
hashtags. We need to make sure that the hook
is good enough. Any first comments can be added.

54
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:55,686
And then do a grammatical check for all the
copy elements. Now, This is also an optional

55
00:04:55,726 --> 00:05:01,448
step, but as always, whenever we publish a piece
of content on LinkedIn, it's always a good

56
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:07,109
idea to include a selfie or an image with it
so that it takes up more space on the feed,

57
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:14,151
thereby attracting more dwell time from the
people who see it on their feed. And it takes

58
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:18,532
up more of the space on the LinkedIn feed as
well, so it grabs more attention or more eyeballs.

59
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:23,890
So it's always a good idea to include a selfie,
not necessary, it's an optional step. but it's

60
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,753
always a good idea to do it. And then finally
the same reviews, the post copy and all the

61
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:33,395
elements in the post and approves it. And if
they're good to go, then it moves on to the

62
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:37,818
executives' approval queue, and the executive
reviews, the post copy and the post elements

63
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:45,262
are good to go. They can be moved to the ready
to be posted user, user queue and it can be

64
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:52,058
published on the user profile and on the company
page. All right. That is the simple structure

65
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:56,019
of the process. The process is more or less
the same as the other content formats, but

66
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:02,822
it's all listed in detail in ClickUp. The sub-tasks
have all been listed, and the action items for

67
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:08,104
each of the sub-tasks have also been listed
in the ClickUp task itself. Now, that's it

68
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:10,064
for the Engagement Baits. See you in the next
video.
