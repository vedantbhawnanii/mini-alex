00:00:01,218 --> 00:00:04,940
So in this video, we're going to talk about
resource giveaways. Now, resource giveaways

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,244
are when you give away a free resource, which
can be a tool, it can be a template, it can

3
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:17,329
be a free guide, or it can be like a niche report
that is valuable to your target audience. Say

4
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:22,252
for example, for Sachin, who is in the crypto
space and the crypto regulation space, the

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,295
giveaway he's offering is that of an ultimate
guide to crypto asset regulations in the UK,

6
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:33,271
which is very important document about what
laws to follow. for crypto companies and what

7
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:38,795
he's done is he's offered a poll in which he's
asked them if they're interested in this resource,

8
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:46,740
just drop a post in the comments below and I'll
send it to you. So what you do in resource

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,485
giveaways is you don't give them a link to the
post right away. You will tell them that they

10
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:58,388
can get access to the resource, this valuable
resource or tool. If they drop a comment below

11
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:02,531
the post or if you're doing it as a poll, You
can ask the question if they're interested

12
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:07,393
in the poll or a related question and they can
click yes or no. And if they click on yes,

13
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:11,696
to everyone who voted on yes, you can send the
resource by messaging them on like that. To

14
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:16,758
everyone who votes on a normal post, you can
message them, you can connect to them and message

15
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:24,763
them and send them the resource. Now let's first
take a look at how the content management process

16
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:29,905
works like as usual for resource giveaways.
And then we'll get into the ideation and creation.

17
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:37,456
of resource giveaways. So this is the ClickUp
template task for resource giveaways. As usual,

18
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:41,857
you first create a duplicate of this and then
you start working creating on resource giveaways.

19
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:48,639
You add an outline, discuss the outline, get
it approved by the executive on the content

20
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:53,101
ideation calls and then you beef out the outline,
add some property deals and source links and

21
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:59,196
then you get started with the creation process.
The process for resource giveaways is very

22
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:03,139
simple. We are assuming that we are working
on existing resource giveaways that we've already

23
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:08,584
created. If the resources need to be created
by yourself, that is a separate process, you

24
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:14,469
need to handle that separately. But if the resources
have already been created, this is very simple

25
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,812
process you can follow for it. You first add
the outline, then you work on the drafts. You

26
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:23,036
create a draft for the post copy for the resource
or for the post copy for the poll that you're

27
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:26,930
publishing with the questions and stuff. then
the content manager reviews and approves it.

28
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,332
Then it goes to the executive approval queue.
And once the executive approves it on the content

29
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:35,294
ideation calls, it can be published on the user
profile and the company page. A very simple

30
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:42,397
process. When you add the outline to the resource,
a resource giveaway post, make sure you add

31
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:46,359
like talk about what the resource is, what pain
points it solves, what are the insights in

32
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,460
the resource? Like how does it solve the pain
points? What are the insights in the resource

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,054
that you're sharing and what messages to be
conveyed? And you also need to add the direct

34
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:58,356
link to the resource file uploaded in Drive.
This is important in the respective session,

35
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:02,138
the description. So when we add resource URL,
it needs to be uploaded in Drive and you need

36
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:11,282
to add the shared, anyone with the link can
access view link in here. All right. But all

37
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:15,504
of these steps as usual have been mentioned
and explained step by step for each subtask

38
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:21,378
in here. So you just need to follow the subtask
process exactly as it is. Now let's talk about

39
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,519
ideation of resource giveaways. So again, the
most interesting thing about resource giveaways

40
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:32,721
is that it can easily be found using Google
search itself. So all you need to do is enter

41
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:39,823
a relevant keyword. So in our case, it can be
construction, project management. So I'm just

42
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:44,484
gonna use that to explain this. Construction
project management is the keyword I'm gonna

43
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:51,536
use and templates. So if I Google for this,
boom. Excel template. So, just from a few of

44
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:56,879
these I am going to get like, I do not know,
20 different resources that I can use. So,

45
00:03:56,899 --> 00:04:02,964
take a look at this. This is a construction
timeline template for Excel. That is one resource,

46
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:07,627
construction budget template for Excel. So,
you could create the resource giveaway post

47
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:12,590
where you discuss this with the executive and
the executive will give some tips on personalizing

48
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,814
this template or on how to use this template
and why is this important. and you could offer

49
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:22,597
it with a guide that you write yourself for
how to create construction budget estimates.

50
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:28,060
So, each of these could be a potential resource.
Now, you should be making sure that you discuss

51
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,523
this with the executive so that they confirm
that this is a valuable resource for your target

52
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:40,126
audience. But as long as that is done, you can
easily find resources online. So, I just use

53
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:46,169
one type of search which is keyword plus templates.
In addition to this, you can also search for.

54
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:51,820
keyword guide PDFs. I could use construction
project management guide PDF and there you

55
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,262
go. I'll find a bunch of PDF guides from other
publishers. I can give social attribution in

56
00:04:56,282 --> 00:05:01,404
the post that's completely fine, but construction
project management PDFs from the Pennsylvania

57
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:06,586
State University, construction project management
templates from Academy Research Guide, there's

58
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:12,709
template.net, there's Coursera guides. I don't
think that's downloadable, but that's fine.

59
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,933
Introduction to construction project management.
So, this must be from some publication that

60
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,534
we can download for free from script.

61
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:30,161
Upload a bit, but we can even tag these sources
so that it is easier. And like you should be

62
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:35,826
collecting like every time you look for resource
giveaway ideas, you should be collecting a

63
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:40,449
bunch of resources like assume like 10 to 20
content ideas and then reviewing them with

64
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:45,123
the executive. on the content ideation call so
that they can choose the best ones and then

65
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:49,404
you can start working on the best ones. So don't
go about like creating like one, finding an

66
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:53,445
idea for one resource giveaway, find 10 or 20
of them. So you have your, you, you go about

67
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:58,907
it in one single step and you can dump all of
them into one single resource giveaway template

68
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:05,148
task so that it's, it's reviewed on the content
ideation calls. Now this is how you go about

69
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:11,070
ideating them. Here are some additional keywords.
So one keyword is Keyword in quotes plus templates.

70
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:18,613
Another keyword is keyword in quotes plus guide
PDF. Another search operator is keyword in

71
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:24,456
quotes plus free tool. So you can also offer
free tools that are available online and explain

72
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:32,139
how to use those tools. Another one is keyword
plus resources. Now in addition to these, the

73
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:38,061
easiest way to go about creating resource giveaways
is taking a look at the gap identification

74
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:42,378
sheet. in the content analysis spreadsheet.
So in the content analysis spreadsheet, you

75
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:45,349
have a gap identification worksheet. And in
here you can find.

76
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:56,206
eBooks, white papers about different stuff that
they've created internally about the companies

77
00:06:56,246 --> 00:07:02,410
that the companies have created internally that
helps them that helps the target audience like

78
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,673
learn about a particular topic. So ideally don't
publish ones from your competitors. Some of

79
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:11,915
these will be from competitors, but if you've
created stuff internally, you can find it from

80
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:16,002
the gap identification sheet itself or from
the existing content analysis sheet. and you

81
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:19,284
just come down and look at white papers and
ebooks. We have not created anything like this

82
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:23,627
client, this case study that we are reviewing,
TraceCost hasn't created anything. So I cannot

83
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,391
show anything here, but in many cases you may
have internal white papers and ebooks that

84
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:34,454
you can repurpose as a resource giveaway post
on LinkedIn. And now let's quickly jump into

85
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:39,878
how to go about actually creating a resource
giveaway. So just like usual, we have outlines.

86
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:47,631
We have outlines for resource giveaways. So
we've found very well performing resource giveaways.

87
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:54,076
And we've reverse engineered each line to give
you an outline. And all you need to do is take

88
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:58,640
a look at each of these lines one by one. Choose
a content topic that is apt to this outline

89
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,923
or vice versa. Choose an outline that is apt
for your content topic. We have about five

90
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:08,648
outlines in here and just start filling them
out. Some of these are my own that have performed

91
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:16,686
very well and have generated a lot of leads
for us. And that is it. very easy PC process.

92
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:21,109
The outlines are pretty self-explanatory, plus
we have information in here on how to use the

93
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:28,213
outlines as well. But that sums up the resource
giveaway format. If you have any questions

94
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:32,635
at all, feel free to drop them in the WhatsApp
community and ask us on group coaching calls

95
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:36,918
because this is an excellent content format
for lead generation, actually generating leads

96
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:43,821
from just from publishing content. And this
post format is engineered for traction. So,

97
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:48,955
When most people vote on the polls to get access
to our resource or when most people drop a

98
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:53,496
comment to get access to our resource, more
of their network will see it. So that induces

99
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:58,638
an organic virality factor in the post and the
promotion of this post. So it's really good

100
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:03,520
for generating leads because only if the people
are interested in that specific resource, that

101
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,142
niche resource will be commenting on the post
or voting on the polls. So that's it for this

102
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,942
format. See you in the next video.
