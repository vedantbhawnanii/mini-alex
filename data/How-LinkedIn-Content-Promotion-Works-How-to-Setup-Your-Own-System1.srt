1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,019
The first step of improving your
LinkedIn content engine is learning how

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,070
content promotion works on LinkedIn.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,139
Before we get into LinkedIn
content promotion specifically,

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,969
I'd like to touch a bit about the
80 20 rule of content marketing.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,409
The 80 20 rule of content marketing
states that only 20 percent of

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:20,819
all your content marketing efforts
should go into content creation.

7
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:26,875
Only 20 percent of the time and
effort you spend on content marketing

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,045
should go into content creation.

9
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:32,484
And 80 percent of it should
go into content promotion.

10
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,294
Now beyond this being a guideline on
how to utilize your time for content

11
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:40,005
marketing, it is a principle that you
should follow for your mindset when you

12
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:41,254
approach LinkedIn content marketing.

13
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:45,085
1820 rule of content marketing means
you should be spending most of your

14
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:49,745
focus on content promotion and it
underlines the importance of promotion

15
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:51,335
in any content marketing strategy.

16
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:55,175
If you take a look at content marketing as
a whole with some statistics, there are 3.

17
00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:58,404
7 million videos uploaded
on YouTube every day.

18
00:00:58,464 --> 00:00:59,675
That's every single day.

19
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:02,745
There's over 2 million blog
posts published every single day.

20
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:06,975
There's millions and millions of social
media posts that are published on all the

21
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:08,145
social media platforms every single day.

22
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:12,225
Now, when there is so much noise on
every single social media platform, it

23
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:17,025
is important to figure out how to promote
your content actively and efficiently.

24
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,784
Now, how does content
promotion work on social media?

25
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:22,974
The difference with social media
or say like publishing a piece of

26
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:26,505
content on your website is that on
your website, you can reach out to

27
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:28,085
a couple contacts in your industry.

28
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:29,365
You can reach out to journalists.

29
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:31,255
And get them to feature your content.

30
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:34,385
You can send it to your target
audience via an email list and

31
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,475
get them to read your content.

32
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:40,065
But on social media, the algorithm decides
who sees and doesn't see your content.

33
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:45,105
It is the algorithm on LinkedIn or
Tok that decides who in your first

34
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,835
degree network or who among your
followers should read the content.

35
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:51,295
There is a network aspect to promoting
your content on social media.

36
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:55,219
So say, one of your connections shares
or likes or comments on your content.

37
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,540
On your video, the algorithm will
show to more of their network,

38
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,480
which can be your first, second
degree or third degree network.

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,220
And as more and more people engage with
your content, the LinkedIn algorithm

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,060
or the Facebook algorithm or the TikTok
algorithm opens it up to more of your

41
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,890
wider network on these platforms.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,220
This is especially true in LinkedIn's
case, even if you have a hundred

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,980
thousand connections on LinkedIn,
LinkedIn will not show your content

44
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:20,060
to those a hundred thousand people.

45
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,400
They will show you
content to a small subset.

46
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:25,715
of those 100, 000 people, which
could be like a thousand connections.

47
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:29,495
And once LinkedIn shows your content
to them, if they engage, LinkedIn

48
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:33,234
will measure their engagement and
then show it to a wider subset of

49
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:34,604
your followers or your connections.

50
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:37,695
And then as more people engage,
LinkedIn will show it to more people.

51
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:39,185
And this trend continues.

52
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:42,335
So unless you gain engagement
consistently with your content, by

53
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:45,775
creating really good content, your
content will not generate a lot of reach.

54
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:49,364
But on most social media platforms
and on LinkedIn specifically, you can

55
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,484
give an initial push to your content.

56
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:52,965
with the help of pods.

57
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:57,095
Pods, that's P O D S, are
communities of content creators

58
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:58,025
on social media platforms.

59
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:01,595
That help engage with
each other's content.

60
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:05,495
So it could be videos, it could be content
posts, it could be random statuses or

61
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:06,715
images, or images of you holding a cap.

62
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:09,925
But these people like, comment,
and share on each other's content.

63
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:13,525
So that it gets that initial push,
which is very important on LinkedIn.

64
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:16,335
The algorithm takes into account
the engagement, which is the

65
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:17,305
likes, comments, and shares.

66
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,605
That you get in the first few hours of
posting, especially the first two hours.

67
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:24,674
So if you get a significant number
of likes comments and shares in the

68
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:28,724
first hour That is a signal to the
linkedin algorithm that your content is

69
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:32,775
engaging and valuable and interesting
think about the scenario You post

70
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:36,005
a piece of content on LinkedIn and
you get one like and one comment.

71
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:39,445
The algorithm is going to assume that
that is not a good piece of content.

72
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:42,704
But if you get like a hundred likes
and a hundred comments in the first

73
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:46,464
two hours after you post something,
that is a signal to the algorithm

74
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:48,734
that your content is very engaging.

75
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,715
But how do you get a hundred likes
and a hundred comments on your posts?

76
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,185
This is what we're going to show you.

77
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,399
In the content promotion lessons,
there are two ways you can do this.

78
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,369
The first approach is using
manual pods and the second

79
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,200
approach is using automated pods.

80
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,450
Let me explain both of these.

81
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,549
Manual pods are communities.

82
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:09,209
Think Facebook groups or WhatsApp groups
or Telegram groups of content creators on

83
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,129
LinkedIn that you can join as a member.

84
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,959
You can share your content and other
members of these communities will

85
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:18,840
like, comment and share all your posts
so that you get that initial push.

86
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,390
And these communities work
on a reciprocal engagement.

87
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,000
So if other members are posting their
content, you will be expected to engage

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,380
with those content pieces as well.

89
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,870
Automated pods are manual
pods in an automated fashion.

90
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:34,679
With the help of software and
tech, you can connect your LinkedIn

91
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,140
account to automation tools like
LinkBoost, Lempod, and so on.

92
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,960
That will help you quickly
gain a large number of likes

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,764
and comments on your posts.

94
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:42,074
Posts.

95
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:42,935
The approach here is simple.

96
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:46,645
You add a link to your LinkedIn post
into these softwares and it can get you

97
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:50,375
a couple hundred likes and a couple dozen
comments in the first one to two hours.

98
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:54,355
So in the eyes of the LinkedIn algorithm,
you are generating a lot of engagement on

99
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:55,734
your content as soon as you post the link.

100
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,465
This will get the LinkedIn algorithm.

101
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:02,385
to open up the reach on your content
to a larger percentage of your

102
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,995
first degree, second degree and
third degree network on LinkedIn.

103
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:09,125
And ultimately you'll get a lot more
reach and views on your content.

104
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:13,114
The other advantage of using Paul's
or content promotion communities is

105
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:16,014
that all the social engagement that
you're getting on this content that

106
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:19,805
you're posting on LinkedIn will give
you social proof as a thought leader.

107
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:22,445
The main goal of content
promotion is very simple.

108
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:24,844
Whenever one of your
prospects on LinkedIn.

109
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:28,095
opens up their social media feed
or their linkedin feed, your

110
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,625
content has to be at the very top.

111
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:33,035
And if you're able to replicate
this consistently by consistently

112
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,845
creating content and consistently
promoting that content with the

113
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:39,464
help of pods, over time, they will
begin to know, like, and trust you.

114
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:42,275
Now let's take a look at how
to join manual pods or set

115
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,695
up an automated pod system.

116
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:52,045
And show you three ways in
which you can find manual pods.

117
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:56,304
And then I'll show you how link
boost works, which is an automated

118
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:57,894
pod tool that we recommend.

119
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:02,820
Now, finding manual pods is It's not
very difficult, but you'll have to

120
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,199
put some work into it at the start.

121
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:09,309
So what all you need to do is go to Google
and search for LinkedIn engagement pod.

122
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:09,769
That's it.

123
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,169
When you do this, it will bring up
a bunch of blog posts about stuff.

124
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,569
But now what you can do is go through
each of these and see if they are

125
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:20,919
recommending any engagement pod.

126
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,419
So If you go into Lempod, which is
an engagement pod tool themselves you

127
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,819
won't be able to find a lot of them.

128
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:36,339
But when you look through the post you
can see like a lot of communities that

129
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:40,329
they mentioned, like Game of Content, this
is a LinkedIn group that they recommend.

130
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:43,834
They have LinkedIn growth hackers,
which looks, seems to be a Facebook

131
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:45,994
group that they recommend that
they've linked it over here.

132
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:51,884
They've mentioned, okay, these are
automatic pods, but this is one way in

133
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,454
which you can go about finding pods.

134
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:57,424
So you'll have to browse around a bit
on Google and find some engagement pods.

135
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:58,804
This is one way.

136
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:03,294
The engagement pods exist on
Facebook, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn.

137
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:05,394
These are three platforms
you should be focusing on.

138
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:09,614
So if you want to look for engagement
pods specifically on WhatsApp,

139
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:12,214
you'll have to enter them like this.

140
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,104
WhatsApp.

141
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,414
And you should be able to find
when you scroll through these,

142
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:19,444
you should be able to find.

143
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,634
Some specific pods that they link to in
whatsapp like publish engagement pods

144
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:28,574
or invite links to whatsapp And you can
join their whatsapp groups and try to get

145
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,254
engagement from those pods and so on now.

146
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:34,389
This is just one way to find it
The next way is to go to LinkedIn.

147
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,119
So again, just you go to
sorry, you go to Facebook.

148
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,039
So the next way to do
this is go to Facebook.

149
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,419
And in the search box, just
for LinkedIn engagement pod,

150
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,879
and you can look for groups.

151
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,359
So these are the groups I'm a part of.

152
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,039
So these are all.

153
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,694
LinkedIn engagement post
growth hacking marketing pods.

154
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:51,804
You can join that pod.

155
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,654
Check if they're active
or they seem to be active.

156
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,264
They post four posts published a week.

157
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,214
This one is 10 plus posts.

158
00:07:58,214 --> 00:07:58,304
Okay.

159
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,254
This is LinkedIn for jobs
are not really relevant.

160
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,139
This is 10 posts a year.

161
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,089
So it's not very engaging.

162
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:05,649
So I'm going to keep going.

163
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,809
LinkedIn networking, six posts a day.

164
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:08,009
Okay.

165
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,299
This one seems to be good.

166
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,669
So I would join that.

167
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,779
VaynerNation, they don't see
how many posts are there.

168
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:15,539
Then I'm going to keep going.

169
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:16,609
I'm going to keep going.

170
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,619
Social media influencers.

171
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,379
So I would join this
and see if it's a pod.

172
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,229
Many of them don't publicly
market them as pods.

173
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:24,259
So they would just.

174
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,904
Name it as social media
influencers or social media content

175
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:27,974
promotion and stuff like that.

176
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,864
So you could look for other
keywords or try joining these

177
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:33,074
groups and see if that works.

178
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:34,304
Engagement groups.

179
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,894
So this is something 10 plus posts a day.

180
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:36,444
They're active.

181
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:40,314
So all of these I would join and
see if they're a good part to join.

182
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,934
This requires some manual checking.

183
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:45,804
The reason I'm not suggesting some
specific parts, like doing the

184
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:49,144
research myself and suggesting some
specific parts is that from what

185
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:53,044
we've seen over time, many groups
tend to become less and less active.

186
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,434
So it's important that you look.

187
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:58,094
For the updated for an updated part is
the most updated part is the most updated

188
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:02,484
communities on facebook or whatsapp or
linkedin that are actively creating where

189
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:06,444
users are actively sharing content and
engaging with other users All right.

190
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:11,199
So this is the second way of doing
it on facebook And the third way

191
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,599
is to look on LinkedIn itself.

192
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,549
So if you look at LinkedIn you can
just search for content engagement

193
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:19,289
pods and click on see all results.

194
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:23,974
And if you filter specifically for groups,
you can see a lot of engagement pods.

195
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:25,399
So this is an engagement pod.

196
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,879
This is a content engagement pod,
but this one is only three members.

197
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:28,979
So I can just close this off.

198
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:32,329
Lawyers, native engagement booster,
not a pod, more impressions,

199
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,369
organically hassle free.

200
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:34,319
There's 23 members.

201
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:35,099
It could be active.

202
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,399
So I would want to open that professional.

203
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,459
So these are all small.

204
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:42,749
So i'm going to move on to the next page
and see personal branding community.

205
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,859
I would try joining this grow your
personal brand become consistent again.

206
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,699
I would join this and see if it's
good quality content for sas sdrs

207
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,479
There's niche specific parts as well.

208
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:55,119
So you could join them
and see if that works.

209
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,129
Otherwise what I would do
is move on to the next one.

210
00:09:59,309 --> 00:09:59,659
All right.

211
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:03,529
Now, please note that you will
have to try with multiple keywords.

212
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,869
So all I did was search for
LinkedIn engagement pods

213
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:06,999
or content engagement pods.

214
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:10,849
You could look for engagement pods
just like that engagement product

215
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,599
for the golden Goldman Lattin.

216
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:14,710
So there's engagement pod, L I E C.

217
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,620
All of these are pods that you
can join on LinkedIn itself.

218
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,260
These are groups that you
can share a piece of content.

219
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:22,485
And get other members to engage.

220
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,935
And at the same time you will need
to reciprocate engagement as well.

221
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,055
So this is how you find pods.

222
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:28,294
Now, how do you use a pod?

223
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,415
So let me pull up like a
pod that I'm a part of.

224
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:33,115
So in most pods, this is how it works.

225
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,035
So they'll post an update.

226
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,635
On like when we should start the posting.

227
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:40,205
So usually on the morning
sometime in your time zone.

228
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:45,965
If they're in your same time zone
and they will ask us to drop them in.

229
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,430
And all you need to do is come in and
drop comments with the link to your post.

230
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,500
This is Facebook, for example, but
it works in exactly the same way.

231
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,689
All you need to do is come in and
drop a comment and people will engage.

232
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,270
And there'll be some ways in which
you can denote that you've engaged.

233
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,420
So this person is liked because these
people, these people have liked because

234
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,180
they've already engaged with this post.

235
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:08,435
That they've shared and the
same manner you reciprocate

236
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,895
engagement on other posts as well.

237
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:12,155
And you get engagement from that content.

238
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,365
Now manual posts are good.

239
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:18,405
You will have to spend at least half
an hour to just dig through Google,

240
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:22,345
dig through Facebook, dig through
LinkedIn to find some good communities.

241
00:11:22,355 --> 00:11:23,905
You'll have to join those communities.

242
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,815
You should also be searching for
bots on WhatsApp because bots on

243
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:28,025
WhatsApp tend to be more active.

244
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:32,465
And after you're done and you find some
communities and you join them, join some

245
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:36,885
WhatsApp groups you need to pay attention
to them for at least a week to see which

246
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:40,935
ones are engaging and which ones you're
getting good engagement from and so on.

247
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:45,975
So once you're done with that what I'd
recommend is, is documenting the pods that

248
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:50,285
you're already part of and making sure
that it's included in the process so that

249
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:54,115
the person who's handling the promotion
of the content actively use these.

250
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,970
Pods are moving forward
for promoting the content.

251
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,990
Now let's take a look at link boost.

252
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,170
Now link boost is an easier way if you're
willing to spend a couple of bucks.

253
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:10,075
Paying for a software that can automate
this process for us because the problem

254
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:13,385
With manual engagement bots is that
you'll have to spend you'll have to

255
00:12:13,385 --> 00:12:16,745
reciprocate engagement So you'll have to
go to their each of their posts You'll

256
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:20,895
have to drop a comment and like on their
posts And if there are considerable number

257
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:24,675
of members in the community if it's an
active community You will have to spend

258
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:26,745
at least like one hour a day to do this.

259
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:30,745
So in my opinion if you take a look at
the expenses for one hour, it's far better

260
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,735
to just sign up to a tool like LingBoost.

261
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:36,305
There are other tools that are
available that do the same thing.

262
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:39,085
So, Lempod is another tool
that allows you to do it.

263
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,215
But what we use is LingBoost.

264
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,435
You can experiment with both.

265
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:46,525
You can use both and try to get engagement
from the users of both tools as well.

266
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:47,505
It's up to you.

267
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,820
But for the sake of this video to
explain the process, I'm going to

268
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,350
explain like how Lingboos works.

269
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,610
Lempod works in, in almost
exactly the same way as well.

270
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,720
So this should work for both.

271
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,470
All right.

272
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,550
Now what is linkBoost?

273
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,560
So what automated pods do is
you can join a bunch of pods.

274
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,270
There'll be other members in those
pods, all of the LinkedIn accounts

275
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,340
of all of those members and you
will be connected to the software.

276
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,230
So the software handles the
liking and the commenting.

277
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,800
You can also input comments that
you want to come below your post.

278
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,119
And LinkBoost will automate
all of that for you.

279
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:24,569
Now, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you how we use

280
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,309
LinkBoost actively to create content.

281
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,389
Sorry, to promote content.

282
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:31,509
So the first thing you need
to do is sign up for a plan.

283
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:34,829
What I'd recommend is when you get
started to sign up for the premium plan.

284
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,279
If multiple users from your team, multiple
members from your team are creating

285
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,769
content, I'd recommend the plus plan.

286
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:43,039
And if you take the you'll be
able to get a bit of a discount,

287
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:46,429
but premium monthly is what I'd
recommend for you to get started.

288
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,519
And later on, you can
move to the plus monthly.

289
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:49,159
All right.

290
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,089
Now I already have.

291
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:54,799
The plus quaternary plan and
I am in link boost right now.

292
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:56,259
It's a simple process to sign up.

293
00:13:56,609 --> 00:14:01,719
You just need to Sign up for the
tool By clicking on get link boost.

294
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,529
You will have to install
a chrome extension.

295
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:06,329
So this is the chrome extension
i've installed and that's about

296
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,044
it and then after you've installed
the Chrome extension, they'll

297
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:10,334
ask you to log into LinkedIn.

298
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,384
So you'll have to log into
LinkedIn from the Chrome profile.

299
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:15,909
So that link posts can fetch
your LinkedIn session cookies.

300
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,809
You don't need to give them the
password or anything, you just

301
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:20,149
need to log into LinkedIn account
from your browser as usual.

302
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:23,034
But once you've done that link, boom,
will link post will automatically

303
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:26,234
connect with your LinkedIn account
and then you're ready to get started.

304
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:29,684
So the first thing that you need to
do is find pods find communities.

305
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:33,699
So even in LinkBoost there are a
lot of communities that you should.

306
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,089
The joining ideally what I'm going
to do now is I'd like you to pause

307
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,379
this video in bits and take a look
at all of these communities that have

308
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,659
at least a hundred members of them.

309
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:46,849
So you can see the number
of members in here.

310
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:49,134
done all the hard work for you.

311
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:52,974
And we've taken a look at all of
the best communities on LinkBoost.

312
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:57,524
So LinkBoost because the engagement is
automated the pods will remain over there.

313
00:14:57,544 --> 00:15:00,374
You will continue to get engagement
from these pods in LinkBoost.

314
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:03,494
So you can take a look at these
pod names and you can search them.

315
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:04,804
In the pod section.

316
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:08,554
So once you go to find pods, you
can in this section, you can enter

317
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:11,874
the names of each of the pods that
I'm about to show you right now, and

318
00:15:11,874 --> 00:15:14,724
you can find them and you can join
them by clicking on this button.

319
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:19,164
So after you search for something,
say digital marketing as an example.

320
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,409
So if you search for digital marketing
as an example, and you find the

321
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:25,669
digital marketing group here, you
can click on join pod, this link,

322
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,269
and a request will be sent to the
admin of this pod to join the pod.

323
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,059
They can also, it can also
be an auto approval pod.

324
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,899
So new members will automatically
be accepted, but some cases

325
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,469
admins will be moderating.

326
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:40,594
The request to join from the new members
and you'd have to wait for approval

327
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:44,594
for a couple of days until you're
accepted, but let's take a look at

328
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:46,414
the pods that you should be joining.

329
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:51,034
So take a look at the pods in here
that have at least a hundred members.

330
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:53,424
So that is what you should be
aiming for to not join any pods that

331
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:54,964
have less than a hundred members.

332
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:56,714
The more number of members you have.

333
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,139
in these pods the better.

334
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:04,279
So what I want you to do in here
is search for each of these pods in

335
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:08,969
the find pod screen, this tab, and
search for them and join those pods.

336
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,949
So that's all you need to do.

337
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:13,339
Once you get accepted to those
pods, you can start engaging.

338
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,649
So growth hacking pod is a good one.

339
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,309
Digital marketing is another good one.

340
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,289
Startups and fintech pod is a good one.

341
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,859
Please note that you need
to search exactly like this.

342
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:26,344
So there's a hashtag At the start you
need to use that then there's sas growth

you want Australian engagement, mutual

347
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:48,379
Indian part again, it's an Indian one,
QAres, digital marketing, this is a

348
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:51,949
small one, you can ignore this, then
we have innovation strategy, digital

353
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:10,214
join the pod and you should be accepted.

354
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:13,774
In most cases, then we have
professionals in the USA only.

355
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:17,024
We have B2B needs and marketing

SAS growth and marketing link.

357
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:18,964
Okay.

358
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:19,684
That's a small one.

359
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,294
SEO and digital marketing,
leadership content.

360
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,749
Startup Mentoring USA, Digital
Marketing Top Influencers, United

361
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:29,959
States, Germany, United Kingdom,
Canada, and B2B Industry, USA Growth

362
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:32,099
Post, USA Healthcare, Growth Pod.

363
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,179
So in this manner, just take a look.

364
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,809
I'm just going to scroll
through the entire page.

365
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:36,749
I think we're about done.

366
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,799
So just go through the remaining
ones and join all of these pods.

367
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:42,089
So I want you to go to Find Pods.

368
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:46,414
This tab, find pods and I want
you to search for these pod

369
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:48,364
names and join all of them.

370
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:52,924
And if you get accepted to these
pods, you should be able to go ahead

371
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,494
and start generating engagement.

372
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:57,914
So just pause this, pause the
video for a couple of minutes.

373
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:01,179
And go through each of the ones, search
for each of these names that you see

374
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,759
on the screen and join those pods.

375
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,129
Now, after you've done joining
those pods you need to start using

376
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,439
LinkBoost to promote your content.

377
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:13,189
And I'm going to show you how to use
LinkBoost to promote your content.

378
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:19,219
So what you need to do here
is click on posts and in here,

379
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,599
there'll be a button for a new post.

380
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:21,979
You see, this is a new post button.

381
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:22,849
So just click on that.

382
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:27,999
And this will pull up a screen where
you can promote a new post on LinkedIn.

383
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:30,639
So what do you need to include in here?

384
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:33,219
What do you need to do to just
start generating engagement for

385
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:35,639
your content after you've been
accepted to a bunch of pods?

386
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,899
So these are all the pods
that I've been accepted to.

387
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,809
So what do you need to do to
start generating engagement?

388
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,179
Is first copy a link to a linkedin
post So i'm going to go ahead and

389
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:49,269
copy a post linkedin post in here.

390
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:53,159
So for example, i'll take one of my
posts i'm going to copy the url to

391
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,349
that post So after you've published a
linkedin post you can copy the url to

392
00:18:56,349 --> 00:19:00,544
that post Like this, you can come in
here and you just need to paste the

393
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:03,014
URL of that post and that's it, right?

394
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:05,354
And then you need to select the pods.

395
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:09,104
There's two things you need to keep
in mind over here and two approaches

396
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:10,734
or routes that you can take.

397
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:16,234
So the first route is if you want to
maximize engagement on all your content.

398
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:21,444
So this is something that I'd recommend
for your for your content pieces that

399
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:23,044
you want, really want to perform well.

400
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:24,504
I'm not talking about salesy content.

401
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:28,094
I'm talking about important
content that you'd like to promote.

402
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:31,914
So if you feel that a content piece is
really valuable, it's really good content,

403
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:36,284
then maximizing the engagement on that
content will make it perform really well.

404
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:40,544
I'm not talking about like say
salesy content or like a webinar

405
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:43,654
promotion post that you really
want to get into the masses.

406
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:45,814
So don't maximize engagement on those.

407
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:51,344
Ideally the ones that you should maximize
engagement on should be the posts that

408
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:54,944
you are sure will perform well because
they're either viral posts or like a

409
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,644
very valuable resource
giveaway or something.

410
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:05,734
Of that sort in the post so in such cases
you can promote that you can maximize

411
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:09,894
the engagement now in order to maximize
the engagement you can auto select pods

412
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:13,524
So what linkboost will do is linkboost
will select the biggest pods that you

413
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:17,814
are a part of So these are the biggest
pods that i'm a part of and in my plan

414
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:22,909
I can promote in 20 pods, promote by
continent, 20 pods, and it automatically

415
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:26,419
selects the top 20 pods that are the
biggest parts that I'm a part of.

416
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:26,729
All right.

417
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:28,179
And I can go ahead and post it.

418
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,019
Now, if it is not like say a post
that you want to maximize engagement

419
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,669
on, you don't want to be doing that.

420
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:39,559
What you need to do is make sure
that you have selected a total

421
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,639
of at least thousand members.

422
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,389
Let me explain that.

423
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:45,659
So for example, this member, this
part is about 445 members and

424
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:47,809
this one is about 722 members.

425
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:53,079
So if I select both of these what happens
is I will have at least a thousand people.

426
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:55,829
If I am getting engagement
from the entire part.

427
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:59,744
So 1000 as a number will is the
minimum number of people that we

428
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:03,944
need to ideally be part of the pods
that we generate the engagement from.

429
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,194
Now the reason I suggest this is
once you've done this for these first

430
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:10,734
two pods, the next time you do it,
you can do it for the next two pods.

431
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:14,769
So I'll have to select one more in this
case to hit the number of thousand.

432
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:18,859
And the next time I promote another piece
of content, I'll select three other pods.

433
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:22,589
So because I do this, I will
generate engagement from different

434
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:24,409
users every single time I publish.

435
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:28,979
And that helps us reach more
wider audiences in the longterm.

436
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:32,339
So this is the approach that I'd
recommend for normal LinkedIn publishing.

437
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:37,669
Just make sure you select as many pods
so that you can generate engagement

438
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,089
from at least a thousand members, there
should be at least a thousand members

439
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:42,719
cumulatively in the pods that you select.

440
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,949
That is what you should keep in mind.

441
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:44,809
All right.

442
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,159
Now after you've selected a bunch of pods
in here I'd like to show you something.

443
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:54,099
LinkBoost also allows you to
include comments for your post.

444
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:58,359
So what I can do is I can click on either
click on generate comments using AI.

445
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,689
So we need to select, enter
the number of comments.

446
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:03,629
So you can click on 30 and click
on generate comments using AI.

447
00:22:04,764 --> 00:22:06,334
Sorry, it's only 20.

448
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:07,554
So let's enter 20.

449
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:08,954
It's my bad.

450
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:14,974
And it automatically generates comments
using AI, but this tool is glitchy, which

451
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:19,264
is why even in one of the previous videos
where we showed you how to generate, use

452
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,084
link boost to generate automatic comments.

453
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,464
We showed you how to use chat GPT.

454
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:27,154
Now I'm going to pull up chat
GPT and show you exactly how to

455
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:28,524
go about doing this right now.

456
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:31,664
So this is chat GPT.

457
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:33,674
You can find it at chat.

458
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,234
openai.

459
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,594
com.

460
00:22:35,694 --> 00:22:37,254
Just go there, sign up for a free account.

461
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,204
You can also sign up
using your Google account.

462
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:44,084
And once you've signed up, just create
a new chat and enter this specific

463
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,074
prompt that I've used over here.

464
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:50,834
So all we do is we enter this very
simple prompt like Prepare 30 comments

465
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:52,394
for this LinkedIn post by your name.

466
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:56,294
So this should be your name the
post author and here are some rules.

467
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:57,054
I'd like you to follow.

468
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:59,254
The comment should contain three
questions, some funny comments,

469
00:22:59,264 --> 00:23:01,714
some positive comments, some
negative and some neutral comments.

470
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:04,674
The comment should be unique and
the length should be in between five

471
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:06,194
words and 15 words in each comment.

472
00:23:06,494 --> 00:23:09,344
Add emojis in five comments
and only in five comments.

473
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:10,084
All right.

474
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:15,134
Here is the post and then we just
copy paste the post copy of the post.

475
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:18,414
So for videos, ideally you should be
adding a bit more description in here.

476
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:23,689
If you'd like but the idea is to generate
good comments that are relevant to the

477
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:29,039
to the text or the post so what I would
do is i'll just copy paste the exact post

478
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,999
copy of the post that I want to generate
automated comments for and chat gpt

479
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,184
will well save us a great deal of time.

480
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:39,554
It takes like I believe like at least 10
or 20 minutes to like put together 30 good

481
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:43,464
comments But chat gpt has gone ahead and
created for us in seconds, and that's all

482
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:48,194
you need to do to generate comments So
for every single post what I would do is

483
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:53,354
open this post in linkedin copy paste the
post copy into chat gpt Use this exact

484
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:58,079
prompt you can type this out from the
video you can mix ideally like what I'd

485
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,629
recommend is creating your own prompt.

486
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,439
So you can personalize this a little bit.

487
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:02,789
You can add more emojis.

488
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,219
You can increase the number of
comments that you want to generate.

489
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,489
You can reduce the number of questions,
increase the number of questions,

490
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:12,469
make most of them funny comments,
make I vary the length of the, of

491
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,279
the comments between five and 15.

492
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,640
If you want longer comments, you
can make it in between like 10 and

493
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,129
30 words in each comment and chat.

494
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:20,289
GPD will do it for you.

495
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:24,114
So what I'd like you to do is prepare
your own prompt, but in case you don't

496
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:28,754
want to spend time on it you can just
copy paste this you can just take this

497
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:33,674
this prompt from the video that I've used
So just pause the video type it out and

498
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:39,334
test this out in chatgpd now After you do
that, you just copy paste the post copy

499
00:24:39,464 --> 00:24:43,244
and that's it And you click on enter and
chatgpd will generate the comments for you

500
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:48,379
And now all you need to do is just copy
paste All of these comments that ChatGPT

501
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:55,359
has generated for you and come back to
LinkBoost and paste the comments in here.

502
00:24:55,579 --> 00:25:00,749
So I guess it's gone ahead and created
the, the, the, the AI comments.

503
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:05,849
But even if this works for you what I can
tell you is that AI generated comments

504
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:10,149
are not very good from LinkBoost if
you created directly using LinkBoost.

505
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,989
Do use doing it using
chat gpt is far better.

506
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:17,009
And sometimes this tool glitches a
little bit So what I'd recommend is

507
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:21,059
using chat gpt It's just that you have
to go out of the tool and just spend

508
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:27,049
like a minute to create it yourself but
it's It's the better process to use.

509
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:31,009
So after I've added the comments
I can choose to add more comments.

510
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:35,019
So we're going to get engagement
from a lot of users So I

511
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:36,139
could add on more comments.

512
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:38,979
I could add up to 100 comments
and you can easily create

513
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:40,899
them by simply asking chat gpt

514
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:47,129
and if you enter something like
this chat gpt will create 30 more

515
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:51,849
comments for you see very simple But
for this video, I'm just going to go

516
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,539
ahead and continue with the process.

517
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:56,879
So the next thing you need to
focus on is, is selecting like

518
00:25:56,899 --> 00:25:58,529
what kind of engagement you want.

519
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,929
Now don't be misled by human
like behavior and viral effect.

520
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:04,719
What works better is
still normal engagement.

521
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:06,099
So that is what I'd recommend for you.

522
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:09,299
The random interval the best random
interval setting that you should be

523
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,079
setting should be 10 to 20 seconds
because we want the engagement to

524
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,979
come in as quickly as possible.

525
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:18,019
You could go up to 20 to 40
seconds or 40 to 60 seconds, but

526
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:20,719
do not choose any of these options
because they're not very good.

527
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:24,074
So 10 to 20 seconds, 20 or 40
seconds or 40 or 60 seconds

528
00:26:24,074 --> 00:26:25,014
is what I would recommend.

529
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,924
You can play around and experiment
with it a little bit if you'd like.

530
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:31,984
Now there is also a setting in
Linkboost that allows you to generate

531
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:33,584
engagement from a custom audience.

532
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,394
So what do we mean by a custom audience?

533
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,464
So you can choose.

534
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:40,244
The locations that, that
you get the engagement from.

535
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:45,444
So even after you've we have about,
I guess we have about 200, 2037 users

536
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:48,004
that will be engaging on our content
from the pods that we selected.

537
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:52,944
But even among those users, you can
choose to get engagement, say only from

538
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,424
Belgium or only from Ireland or only from.

539
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,379
Europe or United Kingdom or,
or Uni, the United States.

540
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,639
So you can filter it
in that manner as well.

541
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:05,329
You can also filter by industries,
but what I'd recommend is

542
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:07,069
going about it like this.

543
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:09,709
What you need to do first
is click on unselect all.

544
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,299
So click on unselect all,
make sure all is selected.

545
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,569
Okay.

546
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,609
So click on unselect all.

547
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,469
Click on sorry, not,
or it's need to select.

548
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:21,859
And so it's unselect all and, and.

549
00:27:22,094 --> 00:27:23,654
And then click on Australia.

550
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:27,974
Then click on United
States, United Kingdom.

551
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:32,524
You can select I don't know, all
the locations for the, from where

552
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:33,864
I want to generate engagement.

553
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:36,574
So all of them will include Germany.

554
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:37,564
India is fine.

555
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:40,914
I would select the Middle East as well.

556
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:43,834
Ireland Poland is good.

557
00:27:44,504 --> 00:27:45,724
Philippines, no.

558
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:47,554
Malaysia is fine.

559
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:50,324
Singapore.

560
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:55,874
So just choose all the countries where
you'd like to generate engagement from.

561
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:59,774
And once you've done that you can
go ahead and select industries.

562
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:05,624
But the issue with industries is
that it doesn't really get you

563
00:28:05,624 --> 00:28:08,184
a relevant engagement of users
from that specific industry.

564
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:10,314
So this is not something that
I would recommend you do.

565
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:13,964
You can play around with it and
experiment with it as you'd like.

566
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,789
But my recommendation would
be to select all of these.

567
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,899
If you're not selecting any industries
you need to click on, or if you are

568
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:25,879
selecting any industries, you can
select on and so what this does is if

569
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:29,539
you select and, and select like a bunch
of countries it will look at, okay,

570
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:32,889
they need to be in these countries and
they need to be in these locations.

571
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:33,409
That's how.

572
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,889
LinkBoost filters it.

573
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:38,279
So if you look for advertising services
and leisure and travel and tourism,

574
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:41,389
they need to be in these countries
that I've selected and they need

575
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:43,529
to be in any of these industries.

576
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,459
That's the way it works.

577
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:49,479
If I'm not selecting any specific industry
and I'm only selecting location, you

578
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,229
can click on all and you should be good.

579
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,619
So we have about 1, 500 users.

580
00:28:55,794 --> 00:28:58,084
So this is the number I was talking about.

581
00:28:58,324 --> 00:29:02,844
Ideally we should be getting engagement
from at least a thousand users.

582
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:04,394
So you should be joining as many pods.

583
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:10,069
Anything above 500 is fine, but I
like to get as much engagement as

584
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:12,009
possible, which is why I try to do this.

585
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:16,989
And once I've, I've gotten this,
I don't select a specific number

586
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,199
of likes I want on the post.

587
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,789
I'd like to get as many likes as possible.

588
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,909
Typically, you should be able to
generate I think this LinkBoost 700 likes

589
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:28,759
for me and up to a hundred comments.

590
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:31,009
I don't usually use the full limit.

591
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:34,919
But yeah, that should give you an
idea on like how much engagement you

592
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,189
can receive in an automated fashion.
