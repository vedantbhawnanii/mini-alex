1
00:00:01,314 --> 00:00:05,817
So let's jump straight away into how to go about
building your own LinkedIn content marketing

2
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:11,822
team. So this is an SOP with a bunch of useful
information that you can use to start your

3
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:17,287
hiring process after you've decided on which
of the team members we discussed in the previous

4
00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:24,413
video you want to have on your team. Now, the
first thing we need for that are the job descriptions.

5
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:29,637
We will need a process to evaluate them, which
is what I'll be talking about in this video.

6
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:34,846
So... The first step is to take a look at this
SOP. You can find the link to this SOP below

7
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:39,973
the video. And in this SOP, we basically have
the job descriptions and the test tasks that

8
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:46,750
you can use to evaluate all of these different
job roles that we just discussed. And in here,

9
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,833
we first have the job descriptions for each
of the roles that we discussed. So you can

10
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:55,757
click on this table of contents and go to that
appropriate section. And we have a very detailed

11
00:00:56,197 --> 00:01:02,542
job description for executive assistant in this
case, the EA role and we have details about

12
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:06,425
their roles and responsibilities in the content
process. What are the skills that they need

13
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:11,769
in the process? Be the number of years of experiences,
what are the manipulation we can offer them.

14
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,053
So this will act as good estimates for how much
you should be paying for these roles. Other

15
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:23,237
people that you hire in a part-time basis for
these roles. And then we have content managers,

16
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:28,881
we have copywriters, we have graphic designers,
we have video editors, and we have sales development

17
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:35,445
representatives. And then we have test stars
that we can use to evaluate each of these team

18
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:40,969
members. So these are all tests that you can
assign to them after you've they've passed

19
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:44,862
the first round. done an initial review of them
or you've talked to them at least once and

20
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:48,783
you can send them the test task. So you can
find everything in here and all you need to

21
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:54,965
do is post it on job posts or send it to them
after you've reviewed that profile. Now how

22
00:01:54,985 --> 00:02:00,407
do we go about the hiring process in a structured
manner? The first step you need to take is

23
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:05,188
to decide on whether you want a full-time person
or a part-time person. I would recommend starting

24
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:08,969
off with a part-time person and then you can
make a decision after you've laid out the process

25
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:16,668
and you have a very good idea on on how to train
them, how to give them feedback, and the process

26
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:22,491
is already built out, then you can scale it
up or put more effort and money into it by

27
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:29,434
hiring more full-time team members or a full-time
workforce for your LinkedIn marketing team.

28
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:34,136
But at the start, it's good to start off with
part-time team members who work on an hourly

29
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:38,217
basis so you can set an expectation with them
that they need to put in two or three hours

30
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:46,123
every day. and that is the best way to get started
with this. Now, how do we go about starting

31
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:51,225
the hiring process? So the first step in the
hiring process is to post this requirement

32
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:57,626
on job boards. So if you are looking for part-time
positions or you're looking to hire freelancers,

33
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:06,729
Upwork, that's upwork.com, then we have free
up, that's free up.net. We have Indeed, which

34
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:15,572
is quite famous and LinkedIn themselves are
very good places to find really good freelancers.

35
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:19,974
Now how do you go about doing this? All you
need to do is you need to sign up for an account

36
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:25,657
in Upwork. So what Upwork allows you to do is
you can post a job, a part-time job or a full-time

37
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:31,479
job and users can come to that job. So skilled
freelancers can come to that job and they can

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,921
bid for that job. So they can either build an
hourly rate or they can bid for like say...

39
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,466
the entire project. In our case, it will be
an hourly rate that's most suitable for the

40
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:45,088
kind of work that we do. On free up, the process
is a bit different. So what free ups gives

41
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:49,649
you freelancers, they put you in touch with
candidates one on one. And the best part about

42
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:54,551
free up is that you have a dedicated hiring
manager or account manager who's helping you

43
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:58,932
find good talent or good freelancers on the
platform. So if you post a job, you may get

44
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:04,506
like two applications at the max. You can evaluate
them and like say shortlist them. If you're

45
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:09,129
not interested in them, you can mention that
you are account manager or hiring manager and

46
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:14,213
they will put you in touch with more applicants
Applicants and you can interview them and proceed

47
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:20,518
with them Indeed is a bit more unfiltered. So
If you post something you'll get like a bunch

48
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:26,182
of spam a lot of inexperienced people applying
but Since it's one of the most used job platforms

49
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:33,134
in the world. You will be getting a lot of responses
so all you need to do is post your job, click

50
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:38,195
on this and post your job and enter all the
details that we have at the SOP for the job

51
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:44,557
descriptions and so on. And finally, we have
LinkedIn. So the interesting thing about LinkedIn

52
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:48,698
is that there's a specific feature on the LinkedIn
profile called the hiring introductory card.

53
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:54,120
So this is the hiring introductory card. You
will be able to find something along the lines

54
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,386
of show that you're hiring or something like
that over here. So what you can do, is you

55
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:05,688
can post the job click on that and post the
job in my case I already have a post live but

56
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:12,371
I can come here and I can add a job post I can
select the company I'm hiring for I can select

57
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:20,014
the job title the company the employee location
the job type and so on I can go in next and

58
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:28,266
I can enter the details including the job description
so I've already filled them out here. The job

59
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:33,669
description and all the details that you need
to enter for any of these websites, not just

60
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:38,512
LinkedIn, but Upwork or FreeUp or Indeed are
all in the job description section. So just

61
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:42,374
go to the job description section for each of
these roles. If you're hiring for an executive

62
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:50,139
assistant, this will include all the details
that platforms need to post a job or post a

63
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:57,263
freelancing opportunity and start getting applications.
So just copy paste this, you can reword it

64
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:03,625
and edit it as you like, but this is the exact
same things that we use to hire our team members.

65
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:11,048
You can just go ahead and use them and create
multiple job posts for the roles that you want

66
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:15,850
to hire for among executive assistants, content
managers, copywriters, graphic designers, video

67
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:22,353
editors or sales development reps. Now, once
this is done, once you've posted the jobs and

68
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:28,555
you're starting to get applications, This is
the ideal workflow that we need to follow.

69
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:36,557
Sending over the test task is the best way to
quickly evaluate applicants. So you don't need

70
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:42,059
to spend your time going through getting on
a call with them and doing a face-to-face interview

71
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,581
with them before you even consider if, or before
you even initially evaluate if they're a good

72
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:51,835
fit for the kind of work that you want to do.
So this is the reason why test task makes a

73
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:57,578
lot of sense. This is a templated test task
that you can send to each of these roles, each

74
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:01,380
of the app candidates for each of these roles
so that you can evaluate their skills that

75
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,843
are specific to this role. So we have different
test tasks for executive assistants, copywriters

76
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:10,806
or content managers, graphic designers, video
editors and sales development reps, varying

77
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:15,989
from content creation to content publishing
to content automation to graphic designing

78
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,435
and video editing to outreach. sales outreach
and outreach management for sales development

79
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:31,360
reps. So ideally whenever you receive an application
you should be reaching out via either via email.

80
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,382
So in LinkedIn you can ask them to like send
you their resume on your email. On Indie the

81
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:40,684
resume will already be available so you can
take a quick look at it. On FreeUp you can

82
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:44,505
take a look at their profile on FreeUp and Upwork
as well you can take a look at their profile.

83
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,453
And after you do like a quick overview, like
should just take a few seconds You've gone

84
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:54,456
through their profile at least once you can
send them the test cast and tell them This

85
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:59,099
is the first round of the interview. All you
need to do is complete this test cast and send

86
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:08,125
it to me This is how we evaluate our candidates
And once the test cast is done You can also

87
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:13,429
mention the next step the next step is to get
on a one-on-one call with you so that you can

88
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:19,734
review the test tasks, the output of the test
tasks with them, and you can also have a chat

89
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:25,407
with them to evaluate whether they're a good
fit or not. One of the things that most users

90
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:38,343
make a mistake with is getting on a call before
the test task. Now, that is a waste of time

91
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:41,686
because you'll be receiving a lot of applications
if you're publishing on all these platforms.

92
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:47,411
It could be in the hundreds as well. And if
you're hiring for multiple profiles, this is

93
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:54,217
going to take a lot of time. But by sending
the test task at the start in a way that doesn't

94
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:58,280
create a lot of friction with the candidates,
so ideally you need to be telling them that

95
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,748
this is how you evaluate the candidates. that
apply for the jobs and this testcast will help

96
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:07,212
you evaluate faster and if you do a good job
with this you'll sail through the interview

97
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:13,157
process so keep them motivated and explain like
what the entire process is about what the next

98
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,820
steps will look like and then send them the
testcast they'll be more inclined to spend

99
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,924
some time on it and finish the testcast and
send it to you and this is going to save you

100
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:21,845
a lot of time because

101
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:31,951
Everyone who's just looking to apply, mass-applying
to jobs, and are desperate, will never spend

102
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:37,396
time to complete the test task. The good ones
will be convinced, and they will spend some

103
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:43,741
time to complete the test task. Now, after they
complete the test task, most of these just

104
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:51,187
explain rules on how the test task is supposed
to be submitted. And after they submit the

105
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:56,998
test task, we can evaluate it. It's pretty easy
to. see what the output is. But if you like

106
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:01,080
the output of the work that they did, the next
step is to get on a face-to-face call with

107
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:08,242
them, an online call with them, IDD, and evaluate
or review the output of the test task with

108
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:12,663
them on the call. So just get on a call with
them, ask them to present their test task and

109
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:18,124
explain how they did it, what they learned from
it. By doing it this way, you can save time

110
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:22,690
on the review process. You can understand how
good they are at what they do. You can also

111
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,094
get an understanding of how good their communication
skills are. So, communication skills are quite

112
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:35,721
important for roles like BDM, CW and CM. So
for these roles, they need to have good language

113
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:42,226
skills, good communication skills and writing
skills. So asking them to explain how they

114
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:46,990
did their test class is a good way to go about
understanding their communication skills and

115
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:55,327
how good they are. And once that is done. You
can make a decision on whether you need to

116
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:59,208
have additional rounds with them, additional
test tasks, you can come up with your own test

117
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:05,929
tasks, but in most cases by the end of the first
round, which is the test task and the end of

118
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:10,511
the second round, which is the face to face
interview, you will be able to make a decision

119
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:15,252
or you will have some candidates that you're
confident about hiring. Now that sums up and

120
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:19,933
the overview of the hiring process. I'm not
going to dive too much into detail about this

121
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:26,252
because it's pretty simple with this step-by-step
process. So step one is going and registering

122
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:33,496
on all these platforms, all of them are free.
And LinkedIn. And the next step is to post

123
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:38,499
the jobs so that either part-time roles or part-time
roles, it's up to you. You can, I recommend

124
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,402
starting off with part-time roles. So post the
jobs on all these platforms. And after that,

125
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:51,005
you can get applications. So take a quick look
at the profiles of these people on these platforms.

126
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:58,171
And if you like them, send them the test task.
Be polite, be respectful of their time. Explain

127
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:02,733
that this is how you evaluate candidates in
the first round and that they will get much

128
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:06,354
further along than other candidates if they
complete the test task and that you do not

129
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:11,115
use the work output that they do in any way
except to evaluate their skills. Just keep

130
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:16,777
them motivated and ask them to complete the
test task and send it to you. And when they

131
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:23,163
respond and send us the test task. You can send
them a Calendly link or send them any meeting

132
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:27,065
schedule links and get them to schedule a call
with you And the next round is the face to

133
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:31,167
face interview. We get a chat. We chat with
them. You ask them to explain.
