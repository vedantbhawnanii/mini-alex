1
00:00:00,682 --> 00:00:05,044
LinkedIn gives you a score called the SSI score
based on a lot of things we do on LinkedIn.

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:11,107
It is a score between 1 and 100 that LinkedIn
gives you based on how active you are with

3
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:15,990
your social selling efforts. Here, they aren't
talking about the traditional conversion rates

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,413
and attractiveness in making quotas. Rather,
the LinkedIn SSI score is focused on network

5
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:26,036
building and engagement factors on the LinkedIn
platform. The consistency that you have been

6
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:30,890
posting, the amount of engagement on your posts
the replies or the comments on your posts, your

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,872
comments on other posts, all these elements
and more affect the SSI score. The LinkedIn

8
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:39,954
group campus has already been designed to look
at all these different elements so that your

9
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:44,976
SSI score increases over time. But this video
is so that you understand the factors behind

10
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:52,239
the SSI score. Now why is the SSI score so important?
Actual statistical studies and research shows

11
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:57,041
that people with higher SSI scores generate
more organic reach for their course and rank

12
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:01,126
higher in LinkedIn search as well. If you take
care of these elements and put in the work,

13
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:06,528
LinkedIn will award you a higher SSI score,
and in turn, you will be able to generate more

14
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:12,009
reach on your content and more search appearances
in LinkedIn search. You can check your SSI

15
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:18,931
score at LinkedIn.com slash sales slash SSI.
I'll add a link to it in the description. To

16
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:25,493
see how you perform and what you present, and
what your present SSI score is, you should

17
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:32,484
be aiming for a score of about 70 or more But
in this video, we're going to explain the different

18
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:38,208
elements that make up the SSI score and how
you can increase it. Now there are four components

19
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:42,691
that make up the SSI score. So the first one
is establishing your professional brand. The second

20
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:47,074
one is finding the right people and then engaging
with insights and then building relationships.

21
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:50,637
What I'm going to do is I'm going to walk you
through each of these and then I'm going to

22
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:58,070
explain what you can do to increase the each
of these individual scores. so that your overall

23
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:04,654
SSI score goes above 70. 75 is really good,
but you should be aiming for at least 70. All

24
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:09,576
right, now establishing your professional brand
is all based on the completeness of your LinkedIn

25
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:14,719
profile, including the endorsements you've received
and the articles you publish and the number

26
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,842
of followers resulting from your articles. It's
not just things you can do, it's also matters

27
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:24,725
like how good your content is and how many followers
you generate from it. But the things that you

28
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:31,014
can do make sure that you are doing efficiently.
So the first thing that you need to do is optimizing

29
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:36,018
your LinkedIn profile. We do cover this already
in the program at an early stage, but one thing

30
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:41,823
you can do in addition to this is reaching out
to a bunch of your contacts and generating

31
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:48,889
endorsements for your skills and that you've
listed on your profile. So the best way to

32
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,653
go about generating endorsements is actually
very simple. It is based on the law of reciprocity.

33
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:59,137
So if you endorse a bunch of your contacts,
say these could be people you know, these need

34
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:05,901
not be people you know, but if you endorse the
skills of a bunch of your contacts, if a security

35
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:11,525
connection is on LinkedIn, chances are they
will reciprocate and do the same thing for

36
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:18,809
you. So all you need to do here is set aside
a task, like assign a task to your team to...

37
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:28,211
endorse 10 contacts, 10 connections every day
and then send them a message asking, okay,

38
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:32,995
I endorse you for the skills, I was wondering
if you set aside a few minutes to endorse a

39
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:37,379
bunch of my skills, I'm trying to increase my
SSI score. So that's all you need to do to

40
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,783
generate some reciprocal engagement, some reciprocal
endorsement you could say on your profile,

41
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:47,907
on the skills on your profile and that will affect 
your SSI score. The next thing you need to focus on

42
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:55,176
is publishing articles on LinkedIn So this is not specifically
newsletter posts. These are articles on LinkedIn,

43
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:59,558
which is a content format on LinkedIn. You can
publish normal posts or you can publish articles.

44
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:05,041
So publishing a bunch of articles can be used
to generate and generating some followers will

45
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:09,783
it from it will help you establish a professional
profile. It will increase the This confidence

46
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:15,166
score which will increase your overall score.
Now, how do you go about doing this? The only

47
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:19,549
thing you need to do is take a look at your
website the blog post on your website and try

48
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,739
to repurpose them actively to your profile.
So this is a recommendation that you can give

49
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:29,481
to the content manager or to the content team.
Who can go ahead and just repurpose the exact

50
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:34,143
same content, just copy paste the content. You
could add a source link at the end of the article,

51
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:40,646
linking to the original blog post on the website.
But that's all you need to do, to quickly take

52
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:45,068
advantage of this one specific element. Now
let's move on to the next one. The next one

53
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:50,675
is finding the right people. Now finding the
right people. is all about creating people

54
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:56,461
searches on a regular basis using advanced filters
and sales navigator. So if you do people searches,

55
00:04:56,481 --> 00:05:01,746
so people searches mean lead searches on LinkedIn
on a regular basis and then use advanced filters

56
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:08,533
that will help you improve this goal to some
extent. If you're running outreach, you're

57
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:15,574
doing this actively. So that's not a huge step
that you have to take. The second one is saving

58
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:20,435
your searches and going through them weekly
to look for new relevant profiles. Again, Expandly

59
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:26,497
takes care of this. In fact, Expandi takes
care of this as well. But the most important

60
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:30,479
element that you need to pay attention to for
this specific component is getting a high acceptance

61
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,200
rate on sent invitations. So when we are sending
connection requests and connection invitations,

62
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,661
we need to get a high acceptance rate on that.
Now, how do you go about doing this? This is

63
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:42,822
about A-B testing. multiple campaigns. This
is something that we already recommend for

64
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:48,824
you in the operation modules. But if you do
that actively and get your acceptance rates

65
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:56,366
to a recommended percentage of 40%, then that
alone will increase this specific component

66
00:05:56,406 --> 00:06:01,347
of the SSI score, which will get you an overall
increase in the SSI score, the overall SSI

67
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:06,229
score. I'm going to move on to the next one.
The next one is engaging with insights. Engaging

68
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:12,967
with insights is a bit difficult to grow. because
it depends on getting engagement on your own

69
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:16,708
posts, like likes, comments, and shares in the
feed. So the engagement needs to come from

70
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:22,551
the feed. So the pod engagement doesn't really
count for this. We've tested this out already.

71
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:28,933
It doesn't count towards this, getting the higher
SSI score for this component. But if you're

72
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:32,455
getting organic engagement on your content,
which means you need to be publishing really

73
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:37,757
good, valuable content, then you will get more
engagement on your posts, and that will eventually

74
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:42,579
help you do this. The pod engagement to an extent
will help you get like it in front of more

75
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:48,361
users, which could get you more organic engagement.
But in the end, it depends on how good your

76
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:53,964
content is. That's why you need to get really
good engagement for your content. The second

77
00:06:53,984 --> 00:07:00,166
thing is the content that you post in groups.
So if you get if you are part of a bunch of

78
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:04,148
communities, you need to be posting engagement
of those communities. And if you generate engagement

79
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:08,529
of those communities, that is good. Now, this
is one of the reasons, in fact, why we suggest.

80
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:15,244
joining engagement groups on LinkedIn, which
we covered earlier in this module. And I asked

81
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:20,826
you to join a bunch of engagement groups on
LinkedIn and actively try to engage with the

82
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:25,168
content in there. So when you post something
and you get engagement on that content or that

83
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:30,230
comment, what's going to happen is it's going
to affect your SSI score as well. The next

84
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,432
thing is the acceptance rate on the emails sent
from sales navigator. Now, this is not something

85
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:39,114
that we usually do because the emails that we
sent by expandi are open emails. So that's

86
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:44,558
a different type of in-mail, but the acceptance
rate on the in-mail sent from your sales navigator.

87
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:50,862
So you get like in between 30 and 50 credits
every month when you have a sales navigator

88
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:55,086
license that you can use to reach out to people
on a priority basis. So you don't need to send

89
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:59,689
them a connection request at the start, you
can just send them an in-mail. But this is

90
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:05,333
a signal that if you get like a higher acceptance
rates on in-mails that you send from sales

91
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:11,126
navigator. you will get an increase in this
engage with inside score. Now the next thing

92
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:18,312
is activities on Smart Links. So this is a very
crucial feature because without Sales Navigator,

93
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:22,576
the usage of Smart Links, it is extremely difficult
to get a sweet score of about 80 for this component.

94
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:30,542
But Smart Links will help you usage of Smart
Links, which is kind of like a feature in Sales

95
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:36,455
Navigator, where you can upload like a presentation.
or a deck that you want to present to people.

96
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:40,538
And it allows you to track the number of users
who are viewing that content. So it's mostly

97
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:46,683
for business presentations and sales processes.
But using Smart Links actively, say if you

98
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:51,246
have a pitch deck or a case study deck that
you want to send to one of your users, upload

99
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:55,530
them to Smart Links and send them a Smart Link
rather than just sending them a link to a Canva

100
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:02,147
file or a Google Slides or a Microsoft Presentations
file link. So instead of that, use a smart

101
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:06,590
link and send them a smart link and that should
help you increase the score as well. Finally,

102
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:13,094
we want the last one, which is building relationships.
Now, for building relationships are all about

103
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:21,600
using the daily, all actions that you take towards
your connection. So it can be starting from

104
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,282
sending them connection requests, sending them
follow messages, which is already taken care

105
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:30,322
of by expandi, liking their content, commenting
their contents, all of these things. are taken

106
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,743
into account. So this is something that is covered
already in our process, so that you don't have

107
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:41,666
to fret about that. And the other thing you
need to focus on is engaging with posts from

108
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:47,509
your network in the field. So you need to actively
look at posts from your network in the LinkedIn

109
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,550
feed. You need to be engaging, dropping a couple
of times every day, and this will help you

110
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,992
increase the build relationships score. The
third one is responding and checking your messages,

111
00:09:56,072 --> 00:10:01,267
invites, and notifications. Now, this is something
most of us ignore. Because even though we look

112
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:04,950
at messages, because they can be messages from
leads and we look at inbound connection requests,

113
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,694
many of us just leave the notifications tab
around. Don't pay any attention to notifications

114
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:16,440
tab. In fact, checking the notifications tab,
clicking on the links in there are all important

115
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:22,905
to get a high score on this. Now, one thing
that we've noticed for the build relationships

116
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:31,107
score is that if you use the LinkedIn mobile
app actively, you can keep the score. And what

117
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:35,729
I will do is, it's a signal to LinkedIn that
you are a more engaged user because you're

118
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:42,491
using the mobile app and that will help you
increase the score a little bit. Now that sums

119
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:49,694
up the different components of the LinkedIn
SSI score. You don't need to think too much

120
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:53,996
about it. We do cover a lot of these things,
but after you watch this video, you make a

121
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:59,835
few notes on what needs to be done. And you
could. Give some recommendations to the content

122
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:04,619
manager or to the content team on the basis
of what you've learned from this video. If

123
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,947
you'd like to take any initial steps to increase
your SSI score even higher. That's it for this

124
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:13,062
video, we'll see you in the next video.
