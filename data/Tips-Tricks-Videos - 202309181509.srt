1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,500
So, I'm gonna walk you through a video right now.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Let's just click play.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,220
You see?

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,960
LinkedIn works.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,760
Differently from most other marketing channels.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,480
Whenever a user.

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,200
Sees a message from you in their inbox.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,080
Or a post from you in their feed.

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,600
The first thing that they do is check out your profile.

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
It's only after they check out your profile do they make that.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,460
So, I'm gonna skip it.

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,440
To the best office rental spaces in New York.

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,140
Or like in my case.

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
I help B2B brands grow their business on LinkedIn.

15
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,940
The work experience listing was.

16
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,740
Simply create a company page on.

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,940
Leading that you can use.

18
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,760
Or simply.

19
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,100
So.

20
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,720
This is what you call a Tips and tricks video.

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,960
Now, Tips and tricks videos are all about.

22
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,620
Tips and tricks that you explain in a video format.

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,280
So, this can be short videos or it can be long videos.

24
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,060
But the idea is to make it really valuable for them.

25
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,200
So, not just a generic video that.

26
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,980
Um, shares and and uh.

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,060
A process or a tutorial that everybody.

28
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,700
Knows that everybody in the industry knows.

29
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,720
It has to be uh, it has to include special hacks or.

30
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,840
A special processes that not many people are aware of.

31
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,380
Or a specific tutorial.

32
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,180
Or process that you use internally.

33
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,880
Or that you've developed internally.

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,240
That would be valuable for your target audience.

35
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
So, it may not be exactly like specific to.

36
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,020
Your core niche and the core industry that you're in.

37
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,320
It can also. Be about general business processes.

38
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,260
That.

39
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,560
Could be interesting to your target audience.

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,700
Now, Tips and Tricks.

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,180
Um, follow the exact same content format similar to.

42
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,980
Um.

43
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,560
Experiential stories.

44
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,200
So, you can find the content format in the content board.

45
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,540
Um.

46
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,980
They follow the exact same process um for experiential.

47
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,320
Story videos um where.

48
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,440
The copywriter creates a script for the video.

49
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,960
And the Content Manager approves it.

50
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,260
And then goes to Executive.

51
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,340
Then the Executive.

52
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,000
Records the video in bits according to the script.

53
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,820
And then the media file is created.

54
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,040
By the video editor from the recording.

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,580
And then it goes through the Content Manager approval.

56
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,960
Executive approval and finally it gets published. So.

57
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,560
Not many changes over there.

58
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,839
The only difference in Tips and Tricks videos is the key.

59
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,320
Topic of the post.

60
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:15,180
And these topics can't be found online.

61
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,740
So all of these.

62
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,780
Topics need to be discussed on the content ideation call.

63
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,339
Call.

64
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,420
So, you need to give the executive the copyrighters.

65
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,220
And the content managers.

66
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,120
Need to give the executive an idea on exactly.

67
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,339
What the tips and tricks video format is.

68
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:30,519
And almost every single executive you talk to.

69
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,640
Will have a very good idea on.

70
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,040
Exactly like what tricks and tips of the trade.

71
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,820
Can they talk about. They can create a video about.

72
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,839
So these are special hacks or.

73
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,040
Special secret sauce elements in their process.

74
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,660
That they use that had them a lot in their business.

75
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,399
So we're just sharing that and sharing value openly.

76
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,280
To our audience using these videos.

77
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,440
That's it. This is just a quick video.

78
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,180
We're gonna move on to the next part in format.

79
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,821
Which is an interesting one called Engagement baits.
