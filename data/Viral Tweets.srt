1
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:09,194
So, this is the viral tweets template in ClickUp.
Viral tweets are all about taking screenshots.

2
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:14,036
Or images of viral tweets and then adding a
post copy, and then repurposing them very quickly.

3
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:19,839
But the process starts with the content manager
creating an outline for this. So they make

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,302
a copy of the template card. They add a name
to it, so they create a copy of the template.

5
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:31,625
Card and change the parent task status to outline,
so that's this outlines, and then they add

6
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:35,146
the post topic in the task title, so that's
over here, they add the post topic, so that's

7
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:40,935
whatever the topic of the post is, section so
that's in here they need to add this description.

8
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:48,192
In here. And then they also need to convey what
the tweet is. So you add to the tweet what

9
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:52,094
the context is, what the tweet is about, what
are the insights, what messages to be conveyed.

10
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:55,936
In the tweet, the source URL of the tweet also
needs to be added in the section so that the

11
00:00:55,956 --> 00:01:01,499
copywriter has a good perspective about what
to write for the post copy and so on, and how

12
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,641
to take the post images. So the next task after
that is you need to assign all the tasks like

13
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:11,423
usual. So you need to assign the drafts to the
copywriter who will be working on it. So like

14
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:19,112
this. Select who the other copywriter is. This
to himself, this to the executive will be reviewing.

15
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:24,799
The content, this to the executive assistants
on the team who will be going ahead and posting.

16
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:25,039
These.

17
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:31,937
After he is done with this, he can mark this
task as complete. So he just needs to select

18
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:39,302
this and mark it as complete. So the only two
sub-statuses for the subtasks are assigned

19
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:48,889
and complete. So once that is done, he can go
ahead and change the main parent task status

20
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,167
to drafts because the copywriter now needs to
start working on it and since it's already

21
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:58,429
assigned it will be visible in the editor queue.
And then the process continues with the copywriter.

22
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,392
Creating a post copy and adding three to four
relevant hashtags, rereading the hook of the

23
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:07,854
post and making sure it's catchy enough, adding
any required first comments, adding the tweet

24
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:14,917
image in the respective section. So if the tweet
when the tweet URL has been added in the outline

25
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:22,960
section, he just needs to open that tweet, take
a screenshot of the and then add the image

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,243
URL in here in the tweet image. He also needs
to add in the first comments in here just to

27
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:34,284
be clear. And then after he's doing that, after
he's done with that, he can take a quick grammatical

28
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:40,888
check of all the post elements, the copy elements,
and then finally move the parent task. So the

29
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:47,694
parent task needs to be moved to the CM approval
status so that the quarter manager can provide

30
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:52,838
and approve it or suggest revisions and then
the sub-task that has been assigned to him.

31
00:02:52,858 --> 00:03:00,168
Which is this one, to complete it. So he goes
here and marks it as completed. That's it.

32
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:08,574
That we have done. Then we move on to the same
approval, So it's this one, which is where

33
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:14,118
the content manager reviews it and suggests
any changes. Now, in case he has any feedback,

34
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:20,563
he can comment with the feedback in here, tagging
the copywriter, the CW, and then move it back.

35
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:31,975
the status of the draft CW task back to assign
so that the drafts so that the copywriter will

36
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:35,817
come back to it and start working on it again.
So if we move it back to assign, it will be

37
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:41,118
able to see it in his queue or if it's good
to go, he can mark his task as complete. The

38
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:46,760
same approval task is complete and move the
main one to the need ex approval status. So

39
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,081
again, it's been outlined over here. You just
need to read through it and execute it. Then

40
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:57,311
if all the post elements are good to go. We
can mark it to Need EX approval status, the parent

41
00:03:57,331 --> 00:04:02,132
task, and mask status of the same approval revision
subtasks to complete. And that's it. And then

42
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:05,753
the executive comes in here. And he reviews
the post copy and tweets me, just like the

43
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:10,895
content manager. He can suggest any revisions,
just like content manager. And if all post

44
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:16,437
elements are good to go, we can mark the status
of the subtasks completed. Then finally, we

45
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:22,524
go to the user profile posting. So if you
can't receive posted on the user profile, you

46
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:27,366
can, they can prepare the first, prepare the
relevant comments using chat GPT, and then

47
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:32,008
add the generated comments as a comment in here.
And if all the post elements are good to go,

48
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:36,270
so they need to make sure that they have the
post copy ready, the tweet image needs to be

49
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,292
accessible. So you should open the tweet URL
and see if it's accessible. The hashtags need

50
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:43,794
to be there in the post copy. So if everything
is done, they can go ahead and publish it on

51
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:47,595
the ex profile as an image post. So you just
need to publish the post copy and upload the

52
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:53,762
image. And then after they publish, they need
to come and add the link, the LinkedIn post

53
00:04:53,862 --> 00:05:04,013
URL in here, and that is it. So after that is
done, they can mark this subtask as complete.

54
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:10,104
Everything is done; we can mark the subtasks
complete and then move on to the next one.

55
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:16,014
This may not be there in some cases if the content
manager chooses not to publish it on the company

56
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:19,740
page as well, but if it is there, then they
can go ahead and.

57
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,407
So if it is there, he can follow the exact same
process that you use for the user profile.

58
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:33,669
In here, he needs to create new comments so
you cannot use the same comments. You've already

59
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:38,211
done this step, so it's not important that you
do it again. You add the link to Post-URL

60
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:44,214
after you publish it on the company page, and
you promote the post separately in the pods

61
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:49,316
with the comments that you generated, and you
mark the ready-to-be-posted company subtask

62
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:57,007
in here as completed. And... And you're done.
Then you can finally move the parent task to

63
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:04,637
the posted status. All right. So this is the
posted status. So that's it for the viral tweets

64
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:06,079
template. See you in the next video.
