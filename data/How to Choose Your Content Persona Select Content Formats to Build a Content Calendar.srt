1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,872
So the very next step in building our own content
strategy is to choose content formats. But

2
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:12,054
before we jump into all the different content
formats, let's talk a bit about content personas.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:15,776
And what do we mean by content personas? All
you need to do is take a look at the Viral

4
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:20,157
Content Marketing book and a specific section
in the Viral Content Marketing book called

5
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:26,720
personas. And what we're going to talk about
here are content personas. So content personas

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,224
are, you could say the personalities that you
adopt or choose to adopt for designing your

7
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:38,128
content strategy. There are three types of content
personas that perform well on LinkedIn. The

8
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:43,532
first is that what we call a viral news guy
persona. The second is that a viral influencer

9
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:48,776
persona. And the third one is that of an niche
expert persona. Now let's dive deep a little

10
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:54,041
bit into each of these personas and what they
are and take a look some examples of content

11
00:00:54,061 --> 00:01:01,407
created by these personas. So viral news guy
persona is someone that focus on one core niche

12
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:09,353
and creates news posts or interesting viral
posts in that specific niche. So they always

13
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:14,157
focus on one specific niche. They don't publish
any and all types of content on any and all

14
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:20,323
types of topics. They always focus on one specific
niche. So Pascal Bornet is a very good example

15
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:26,308
of a viral news guy. What he does is he's a
LinkedIn top voice. He only focuses on tech

16
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,269
focused content. Now If you take a look at the
content that he published, this is a viral

17
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:36,075
news video from that was created by some other
company called EEAGLI. So it looks like a data

18
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:41,202
analysis company and this compares how the mobile
phone market changed over 30 years. It's a

19
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:46,309
video. Now what Pascal did is he...

20
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:53,887
repurposed the content published by this guy
so he's added source attribution in here and he's

21
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:59,570
repurposed that content and he's published it
on LinkedIn so he chose this because again

22
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,532
it's over the tech market so he only talks about
tech he doesn't talk about other topics but

23
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:09,474
tech is a broad niche so there's a lot of things
to talk about within tech and he only publishes

24
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:14,676
content like this here's another example so
this one is created by Quantum Techs which

25
00:02:14,696 --> 00:02:20,959
is another company and this is a video about
a viral news video about a first augmented

26
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:27,885
reality lens becoming real. I guess that's an
implanted lens and you can see the engagement

27
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:35,091
that he has received on these content pieces
as well. Now why does the viral news guy persona

28
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:42,237
work really well? Now the interesting thing
about this persona is that almost all of the

29
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:46,981
content that they publish is sourced from other
social media platforms. It's almost never original

30
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:52,520
content. They always source it from other social
media platforms. They publish content in multiple

31
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,602
formats. So it can be a video, it can be an
image, or it can be other formats. And they

32
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:02,644
also give source attribution to the content
that they publish on their profiles if they

33
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:09,047
source it from somewhere else. But the goals
of this persona is to build a large, industry-relevant

34
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:16,451
audience. And they only focus on creating content
using by repurposing content that is performed

35
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:23,577
well on other social media platforms. And they
publish multiple times a day, which is one

36
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:31,104
of their differentiating factors about their
content. So on average, we tend to publish

37
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:35,388
content only once a day, but they publish content
multiple times a day because they're confident

38
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:39,632
that perform well, again, because they only
take content that is performed well or proven

39
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:47,857
to work really well on other social media platforms.
Now, after the viral news guy persona, we have

40
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:53,201
the niche expert persona. Now, what is a niche
expert persona? So you could say both Alex

41
00:03:53,361 --> 00:04:00,768
and me are choose the niche expert persona for
our content. So the goals of the niche expert

42
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:04,771
persona is to build an industry-specific audience.
So we don't want a generic audience like entirely

43
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:11,897
in tech. We want users who are specifically
say, interested in LinkedIn marketing and interested

44
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:15,932
in... learning more about LinkedIn marketing
and understanding more about the generation

45
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:22,377
of sales, social selling topics like that, and
that a more potential customers of the product

46
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:28,401
or the service that I offer. Now, the reason
I choose this personalize because with expert

47
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:35,786
content in that specific niche, I can build
trust faster in that specific niche, which

48
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:42,770
is much smaller than say tech in general. But
The brand that you can generate and the revenue

49
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,753
that you can generate even with a small audience
in the niche experts with the niche persona

50
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:52,676
is larger than what you can generate with the
viral news guy persona or the viral influencer

51
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:56,859
persona. So that's the advantage. I'm not suggesting
that the niche expert persona is far better

52
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:03,222
than the viral influencer persona or the viral
news guy persona. So these are all good personas

53
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:07,425
to choose from because of the amount of effort
that you put into the content marketing process

54
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:13,188
and the amount of returns that you get from
it. So the viral user persona focuses on creating

55
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:20,434
content in specific formats. But again, it's
almost always original content that they themselves

56
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:26,879
created with research or from their own knowledge.
But they rarely plagiarize or copy content

57
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,422
or repurpose content that is performed well
on other social media platforms. They may gain

58
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:34,545
inspiration from them and choose topics from
content pieces that are performed on other

59
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:40,610
social media platforms. But almost always they
create original content. that is interesting

60
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:47,235
to their specific target audience on LinkedIn.
Now after the niche expert persona, we have

61
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:51,898
one more persona, which is the viral influencer
persona. So the best way you could say to explain

62
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,823
viral influencer persona is an influencer or
a wannabe influencer, a creator on LinkedIn,

63
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:06,048
who is publishing content on any and all topics,
any and all niches, any and all formats. The

64
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:12,069
only criteria is that it performs well. So all
he does is he finds viral content on LinkedIn

65
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:18,115
that is performed well on other social media
platforms as well as LinkedIn. And he repurposed

66
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:23,740
that content for his profile. So almost always,
almost all the content that they publish on

67
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:29,566
their profiles are repurposed content. The amount
of original content they publish is little

68
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:36,931
to zero. But... They borrow or repurpose content
that has performed really well on other social

69
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:40,852
media platforms, so viral content essentially,
and they publish that on their LinkedIn profile.

70
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:48,634
The goal of this persona is to reach as many
users as possible and maximize the reach of

71
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:54,156
their content by choosing only viral posts.
And irrespective of industry or niche or subniche,

72
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:58,497
they want to build a large audience and a large
follower base on LinkedIn. Now let's take a

73
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:04,351
look at some examples of specific persona. So
you can ideally recommend when you check these

74
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:09,394
examples out, you can easily search them on
LinkedIn, take a look at their content and

75
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:15,237
form an understanding of how they differ from
each other. So the best example of viral influencer

76
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:20,480
persona is that of Daniel Abraham's. So Daniel
Abraham's publishes content on any and all

77
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,163
topics and he's quite viral and pretty sure
he's got over 1 million followers now. And

78
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:30,058
he's doing a great job with simply repurposing
content that he finds from other sources. and

79
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:35,820
publishing it on his LinkedIn profile. Anne
Handley is the, I believe she was the CMO of

80
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,103
marketing drops, a famous marketing run. And
she is also a good example of the viral influencer

81
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:46,945
persona because they publish content, she publishes
content on well, every single topic under the

82
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:52,147
sun, so it can be any content or in any format.
All she focuses on is making sure that it is

83
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:58,129
viral or it has gone viral in the past on other
social media platforms or on LinkedIn. So these

84
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:05,390
are the core. um personas and each of these
personas we've segmented content formats for

85
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:11,074
you. So in the content format sheet we have
the content formats that you can use to create

86
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:18,098
content. If you choose any of these personas,
so all of these have separate content formats

87
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:24,784
that you can use. Obviously the viral news guy
and the viral influencer persona are, have

88
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:28,007
content formats that are way more easier to
create. The processes for creating content

89
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:32,671
with these personas are way more easier to create.
But what I want you to do is make a decision

90
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:38,456
now on which persona you want to choose. Now,
it's not necessary that you focus on one persona

91
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:43,260
alone. You can use a hybrid between niche expert
persona and viral influencer persona, or you

92
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,576
can use a hybrid between. me, Shakespeare, persona
and viral news guy persona, but ideally don't

93
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:55,201
combine all three because combine all three,
it's going to be ineffective to some extent.

94
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:02,299
But after you've made a decision on what hybrid
you want, what I'd recommend that you do is

95
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,122
you make a hybrid between the niche expert persona
and the viral news guy persona. So say, suppose

96
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:11,883
you are in the construction space, like the
case study that we talked about in the previous

97
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:17,086
videos and the modules. If you're in the construction
space, you can publish niche expert content

98
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:21,988
on the construction niche, and at the same time,
you can repurpose content in the construction

99
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,689
niche that is performed really well on other
social media platforms, and you can publish

100
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:32,608
them on LinkedIn. or other social media platforms.
So the first thing you need to do is decide

101
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:37,069
on what persona you need to choose. You can
choose a hybrid between two of these personas.

102
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,871
But after you make that decision, the next step
is to think about what are the content formats

103
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:48,834
in each of these personas that we selected.
So once you make that decision, all you need

104
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:55,437
to do is make a list of content formats that
you want to start experimenting with in the

105
00:09:55,497 --> 00:10:01,576
content format queue. So the content format
queue is a queue of different content formats

106
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:08,060
that you want to test on LinkedIn. And it's
not necessary that you use all of this. So

107
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,603
you'll be choosing some content formats or prioritizing
some content formats from the content queue.

108
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:17,626
Content format queue into content formats and
we're going to test them out and decide on

109
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:22,269
which ones you want to use long term. But for
the time being, what you should be doing is

110
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:26,063
you should be copying these. and pasting this.
So I'm gonna choose a hybrid between the Niche

111
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:31,726
Expert persona and the Viral Niche Guy persona
for the case study prompt in the construction

112
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:38,350
niche. So what I'm gonna do is I am going to
choose these and paste them in here. I'm gonna

113
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:44,894
choose these and paste them in here. And the
next step after this is to include content

114
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:50,317
formats you wish to include in your content
strategy. So we did the gap identification

115
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:57,775
and we already got... an idea of different content
formats that we want to be using. So we have

116
00:10:57,835 --> 00:11:03,457
carousels or slide posts, which we already have
in the content format sheet. So in the content

117
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:09,339
format sheet, we already have carousels or slide
posts. So I'm going to keep moving on. We have

118
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:13,280
text posts already, experiences stories and
informative posts that include carousels again,

119
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,221
image posts with text, of course, and those
are what we call informative posts. That's

120
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:25,406
fine. we have event or conference snippets.
This is more of a news post or information

121
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:31,311
post, so we already have that. Explainer video
is something that is new in here. So what I

122
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:36,275
would do is include an explainer video in here
because that is something that we want to look

123
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:43,381
at. And we have a VSL, which is also new. So
I would include that in here. And then we have

124
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:49,854
actionable tutorials. So actionable tutorials,
I haven't yet made up my mind on what format

125
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:53,715
it should be in, but actionable tutorials is
something that I'm going to include in here.

126
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:58,976
And then we have webinars. Webinars are an entirely
different process. We're already covering it

127
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,277
separately in the Imagine Growth process because
they're very effective. So I'm not going to

128
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:08,659
cover them over here, but you now know that
you need to focus on webinars as well. We have

129
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:13,440
white papers and ebooks, different kinds of
white papers and ebooks. So I'm going to include

130
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,906
that as well in content format. So white papers
on a specific point. our pain point data study

131
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:24,908
and then we have industry report process template.
So my oh my, we have a lot of stuff in here.

132
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:30,449
And so we have process templates, guide or actionable
tool. And we've already included in here. So

133
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:36,491
I'm going to move back. Then we have again webinars,
conferences, conferences again is an entirely

134
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:41,312
different kind of strategy. I'm not going to
include it here. The interview podcast series

135
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:46,613
of the interview podcasting. That is a very
interesting addition from the gap identification

136
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:52,493
sheet. And then we have newsletters. Newsletters
is something we can consider. But newsletters

137
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:57,917
as well is a separate section in the LinkedIn
Growth campus because we cover it in detail because

138
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:03,622
it's a very good content format. But I'm going
to cover that right now. But we need case studies

139
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:09,026
and customer experience stories are some good
content formats that we can consider. So what

140
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:16,510
I would do is ideally use customer experience
stories than case studies because This is a

141
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,894
content format that performs better on LinkedIn.
Plus we already have it in here, customer experience

142
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:28,877
stories. So I could go ahead and add case studies,
but to an extent, customer experience stories

143
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:33,940
come from case studies and then vice versa.
So I'm not gonna add case studies as well in

144
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,823
there because we already have customer experience
stories. And then we have testimonials, which

145
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:49,698
is something that I could add in here, testimonials.
We have product features. Product feature is

146
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:54,042
above full video, but this is not something
that I would consider much adding on LinkedIn.

147
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:59,328
But we could consider that part of the company
page. So I'm gonna include all of them in here,

148
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:06,888
and I'm gonna... Make sure the formatting is
correct. All right, so we have some content

149
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:12,911
formats documented in here now. And now that
we've included all of these formats in here

150
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:18,214
that we want to test out, the first thing we
need to do is select five of them that we should

151
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:23,717
prioritizing. So what my recommendation would
be take experiential stories because there

152
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:28,140
are good content format. Slideposts is one of
the best content formats you can use on LinkedIn.

153
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,128
If you have a lot of lead magnets that you've
created internally, say white papers, templates,

154
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,092
guides and so on that you can give away for
free. Ideally PDFs or like tools that you can

155
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:47,196
give away for free internally. You can use resource
giveaways but otherwise my best recommendation

156
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:52,299
would be to offer Q&A videos. So Q&A videos
are a good content format. So these would be

157
00:14:52,339 --> 00:15:00,036
the three ones I would select for this use case
which is construction niche. And then the remaining

158
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:04,920
two slots on the content calendar. So those,
assuming we have a five day work week. So that's

159
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,505
Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and
Fridays. Three of them are filled and now we

160
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:15,309
have two more. Now two of these should be experimental
slots. Now what I mean by that is you should

161
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:20,054
be experimenting different content formats in
these slots and seeing what is working and

162
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:24,157
what is not working. So what I'd recommend is
going ahead and maybe doing an experiment.

163
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:29,126
Informative post and a fun video is too much
work, these are all videos, I would also use

164
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:33,690
an engagement bait. So I would test out these
formats, see whether they're working. If they're

165
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,975
working well, I will continue to do it. Maybe
I'll try switching out some other stuff. And

166
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:42,018
I'll continue testing with more and more content
formats from the content format.
