1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,160
So the first thing you want to do
is create an endorsement and liking

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,640
post liking campaign for your first
degree connections in, in in LinkedIn.

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,529
And the way we do that is we first
come to sales navigator lead search

4
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,949
and we click on connections and
we select first degree connections

5
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:20,859
and then click on see all filters.

6
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:27,689
And if your network size is over 5,
000 connections on LinkedIn you can

7
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,189
filter for the people who've posted
on LinkedIn in the past 30 days.

8
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:36,109
If your network size is below 5,
000 connections, you don't need to

9
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:39,619
include this filter so that you have
a sizable number of people in this

10
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:43,919
list a sizable number of people that
you reach out to, but I am going

11
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,299
to select posted on LinkedIn in the
past 30 days because my network size

12
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,959
is well over 5, 000 connections.

13
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,079
So we connect, select the connections
and the posted on LinkedIn in 30 days.

14
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:55,319
And the next thing you need
to select is the geography.

15
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,369
So the geography should ideally be
The target locations that you're

16
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:00,459
focusing on on a country level.

17
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:03,459
So if you're targeting Canada,
for example, so for trace

18
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:04,499
cost, we're targeting Canada.

19
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:07,119
So I'm going to take that as an
example, I will select all of

20
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,329
Canada as the target geography.

21
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,149
And in addition to that, I will also
select the United States because

22
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:15,429
that is also a target geography.

23
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,909
So we have about 4000 people in this list.

24
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:19,864
And yeah.

25
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:25,214
Expatly only allows imports up
to 2, 500 per search, which is

26
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:29,324
why I will segment this list now
into two separate lists ideally.

27
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:33,764
So one thing you could do is you
could look at the company headcount

28
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:35,384
and select like two separate buckets.

29
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:41,365
So I will go every anywhere
up to say self 2, 500.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,470
Yeah.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,260
So this, these three lists
make up about 2, 500.

32
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,310
And this is the first list I will take.

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,140
And the next list I would take
would be the remaining buckets.

34
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,790
So I would remain, remove
all of these still 50 people.

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,280
So this is the first list I will import
into expanding, but the next list I will

36
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,870
import into expanding will be this one.

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,100
So up from 51 and above.

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,080
I will select the remaining people
and I will try to activate them.

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,320
So this will be the remaining people,
that's 2, 000 about 2, 000 results.

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,710
So I will take both these lists
and I will import them into Expandi

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,240
that process is pretty simple.

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,770
All you need to do is
first go into Expandi.

43
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,689
So this is my Expandi and then
click on search to load the search

44
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,819
box and then copy the URLs of
both the searches that you want.

45
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:35,179
So I'll copy the search URL.

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,749
I come in here, I click on add
new search and I will choose sales

47
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,529
navigator search, enter the search name.

48
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:50,309
So this is supposed to be a
network post campaign one.

49
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,440
So this is the first one.

50
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,510
So I'll just click on next.

51
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:59,635
I'll enter the search URL and I will click
on search and now Expandi will go ahead

52
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:01,975
and scrape 2, 500 results in that search.

53
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,174
It's loading right now.

54
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:10,135
And in the meantime, I will go to
campaigns and I will create a new

55
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:16,545
campaign which is a smart builder campaign
for getting endorsements and liking

56
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,905
for giving endorsements and liking.

57
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,455
Posts of the people in this list.

58
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:25,525
So let's just wait for
the campaigns to load.

59
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:29,205
It's still in search.

60
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:32,105
Let's load that.

61
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:32,695
Okay.

62
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,735
The campaigns are loading.

63
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:37,205
And what I'm going to do now is
click on add campaign and click

64
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,755
on campaign builder in here.

65
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,464
So I'm going to give it a campaign name.

66
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:46,215
So this is a network activation campaign,

67
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:54,545
click on next, and then click
on create without template.

68
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:58,525
And after we create the campaign,
it will open up in a while.

69
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:03,925
And this is what the
campaign will open up to.

70
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,505
So this is the smart builder
campaign where we can add

71
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,105
additional actions for each.

72
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,220
Person in that list.

73
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,050
So what I will do is I will add skill
endorsement as the first step and

74
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,320
then like a post as the next step.

75
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,720
You could add additional steps for
visiting profiles and follow profiles,

76
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,850
but this is already being done by
Expandi for a lot of other accounts.

77
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,240
So you're actively running campaigns, so
you don't want to affect the limits of

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,500
those campaigns, which is why these, this
is the bare minimum that you can set up.

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,010
And what I will do is I
will connect these in here.

80
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:41,625
So we need to add a check condition
for whether they're connected or not.

81
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:47,655
So if connected, we'll mark it in here
and we'll connect this to if connected

82
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:49,915
and this tick is for if they've connected.

83
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:54,094
So we connect this to this
and the next step after if

84
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,165
they've connected is this one.

85
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:02,535
And after you set this up, you can
just click on this save button in here

86
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:08,195
to save the campaign and that is it.

87
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,555
You've selected, you've saved this flow.

88
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,510
You can also configure the first
step stats so you can check You can

89
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,010
set a time delay, but I wouldn't
recommend setting a time delay.

90
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,240
Maybe you can set like 15
minutes after as a time delay.

91
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,270
But then you also need to like their post.

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,860
So for this, I would set as one delay.

93
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,550
So we first send them an endorsement and
then one day later we send them a like.

94
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,349
That is the way I would do it.

95
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,220
And then after that we need to
take a look at the setting screen.

96
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,300
So you click on, okay,
you need to save it.

97
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,850
So.

98
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,070
I set this as 15 minutes again, click
on this and this is selected as one day.

99
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,320
These are steps for like say when the
last engagement is there the minimum

100
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,610
number of likes that the post should have.

101
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,560
So it shouldn't be like a
post with like literally zero.

102
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,899
You could enter this as five.

103
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,560
That is the bare minimum I would go with.

104
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,029
And you could enter keywords for posts.

105
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:03,729
So only the posts with those
keywords would be engaged with,

106
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:06,439
but I wouldn't recommend using this
because it's not necessary that

107
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,959
they contain a specific keyword.

108
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:11,049
Once this is done, you click on save.

109
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,779
And then once Expandi shows the green
button with steps are successfully

110
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,129
saved, you go to settings.

111
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,619
And in the settings, we need to set the
number of new people to be contacted by

112
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:22,019
the first actions of the campaign daily.

113
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:25,499
So ideally I'd like at least
30 people contacted per day.

114
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:26,709
So you can increase this.

115
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:30,369
But I would, since you have other
campaigns running, I would set it at 30.

116
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,739
If you don't have other campaigns
running, you can set this up to 70.

117
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:35,169
It's fine.

118
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,999
But if you have campaigns running
parallelly, 30 is the ideal

119
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,359
number that you need to set.

120
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:40,469
All right.

121
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,709
You can increase this over time.

122
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:42,219
It's fine.

123
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,709
But at the start When you're
working on this, just start it

124
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,879
off at 30 and then click on apply.

125
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,609
And these settings should be updated.

126
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:53,379
And now we go to people and in here
we need to import the prospect.

127
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,899
So let's take a look at whether
a search is loaded completely.

128
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:59,749
So if I go back to search I will
be able to see the search that

129
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:02,549
I just ran from sales navigator.

130
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:08,609
So my network booster search is loaded,
so I'll just click on it and I now need

131
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:12,219
to assign these prospects to a campaign.

132
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,139
So what I will do is I will click on.

133
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,079
Assign filtered contacts.

134
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,829
So we click on assign filtered contacts.

135
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:20,909
We select a campaign.

136
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:23,719
So just type the name
of the campaign in here.

137
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,529
So I have the network activation campaign.

138
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,809
So I just click on this, I
click outside and click on add

139
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:30,379
filtered contacts to campaign.

140
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:34,129
So sometimes when you add this, a lot
of Expandi will show a notification or a

141
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,249
pop up saying that there are duplicates
in, in the campaign or the duplicates

142
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,639
in the existing campaign and so on.

143
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:40,839
That is completely fine.

144
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:44,229
Some of the prospects will,
could be there in other expanding

145
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,209
campaigns that you're running.

146
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:49,879
So they may they may, they may be
removed automatically, but now if I

147
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,959
go to the campaign and I take that
specific campaigns, if I go to campaigns

148
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:02,089
right now and search for work, I can
now find that my network activation

149
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,169
campaign is, is ready with two, three.

150
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:04,319
Thank you.

151
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,569
9 1 1 prospects.

152
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,639
So from about 2, 500, about 100 prospects
were removed because they were running,

153
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:10,809
they were included in other campaigns.

154
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:11,659
That's completely fine.

155
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,559
And now we need to
switch on this campaign.

156
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,279
So all you need to do is click
on status and the network

157
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,779
activation campaign is live.

158
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,939
And that's all you need to do to.

159
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:24,594
Run an endorsement and liking campaigning
using smart builder campaigns and Expandi.

160
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:28,104
Now that was the first step in
activating your existing campaign,

161
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,614
existing network on LinkedIn.

162
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:37,334
The second step is commenting
on other posts on LinkedIn.

163
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:39,924
So commenting is a very
important activity.

164
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:40,974
It is an art in itself.

165
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:45,114
And dropping a comment on a LinkedIn
post is a very good way to prime

166
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:48,144
your network, even generate positive.

167
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:51,444
Results by optimizing
it for the algorithm.

168
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:55,814
So if you do it immediately before
publishing a post, that is the

169
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:59,844
best time to do it because the
algorithm will prime, will be primed

170
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:02,084
for your post to be published.

171
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:06,744
And just because you've dropped a comment
on several other posts in the feed or in

172
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:11,324
the sales navigator feed or on influencer
posts your post will generate more

173
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,884
result, more reach as a result immediately

174
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:17,494
So the first thing I'll show you
how to do is finding posts from the

175
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:18,944
LinkedIn feed and commenting on them.

176
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,154
The target for these is 10 per day.

177
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:25,394
So ideally the ideal time for doing
this is right before you publish.

178
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:28,354
So you should be starting this process,
say like half an hour before you

179
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,974
publish the post or whatever time
you publish the post on that day.

180
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,694
And the way you go about doing this
is you go to the LinkedIn feed.

181
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:37,759
So this is my LinkedIn feed of the case
study client that I want to show you.

182
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:41,979
So we'll go through this feed and
we'll take a look at relevant posts

183
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,809
that have somewhat good engagement.

184
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,919
So I'm going through this, I'll
see like some stuff about wire and

185
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,499
cable industry, not very relevant.

186
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,309
Plus they don't have
like a lot of engagement.

187
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:55,969
This one is about Shakuntala Devi
who is a human is a mathematical

188
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,089
genius solving problems.

189
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:58,499
Let's move on.

190
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,849
This one is about polarization,
equity, diversity and inclusion.

191
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,569
Yeah, it's an okay topic.

192
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,269
You can comment on it, but
it's not really relevant.

193
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,109
So I'm not going to do it.

194
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:15,464
Let's take a look at space planning
data stories, hmm, data is one of our

195
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:19,654
clients for this client for pre order.

196
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:25,534
Okay, this is an okay post, it has
good engagement as well, but no, this

197
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:26,784
is not something I would look at.

198
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:30,524
I'm going to keep doing this until I
find good posts that I can talk about.

199
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:32,264
Sifarish,

200
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,624
this one is about some
LinkedIn posting stuff.

201
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:47,224
I know that this is a construction
company and this is the founder

202
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,334
of that construction company.

203
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:51,644
And this is somewhat okay engagement,
120 likes and five comments.

204
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:53,604
This is a post I would comment on.

205
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:56,084
So there's two ways you
can go about doing this.

206
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,954
One is manually taking a look at
this and dropping your comment.

207
00:10:59,314 --> 00:10:59,714
And.

208
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:03,894
This is how I would comment on this post
and almost all posts in the same format.

209
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:07,044
So, what I would first
do is tag the author.

210
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,374
Tagging the author is important.

211
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:10,544
We need to grab their
attention with this comment.

212
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:14,904
So what I would do is say something
along the lines of let me read the post.

213
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:17,014
It feels great when you appreciate
the work of what you've built to

214
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,004
help you during this new journey.

215
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,134
Teams, I must thank everyone
who has worked with Kalpataru.

216
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:23,544
So much of a framework known
as Javi, but without my cross,

217
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,539
Donna, Paulson, and team.

218
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:25,749
Okay.

219
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:26,759
Can't.

220
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:30,929
So I'm going to say can't beat the
suits analogy because I know that

221
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,539
this is from a series called suits.

222
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,829
So I'm going to say can't
beat the suits analogy.

223
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:43,489
Maybe I would say something like,
and Jessica wouldn't be Jessica

224
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:52,799
without having Jessica without having

225
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:58,274
so medical stop over there and say, can't
be in the seats analogy produce to watch.

226
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:02,574
You accomplished.

227
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:07,744
I know you will tag him again.

228
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:08,724
You can tag him multiple times.

229
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:09,104
That's fine.

230
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:13,434
And then ideally we need to end the
comment with a question so that they

231
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:17,634
feel prompted to respond and they
under, let's say, getting replies to

232
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:18,934
our comments is a good thing again.

233
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:21,624
So ideally I would end
it off with a question.

234
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:24,744
So Sometimes life in success
feels overwhelming if you

235
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:25,704
rise back from the dead.

236
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:27,644
I appreciate you rewarded for
what you have built, but with

237
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:28,784
the good it's also overwhelming.

238
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:31,524
And while this is a new journey
new team is being built.

239
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:34,284
I must thank everyone who is being worked.

240
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:36,564
Okay, let's talk about

241
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:37,874
Okay, it's a new journey.

242
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,024
He mentioned it's a new journey.

243
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,254
So maybe you could ask
about the new journey.

244
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,124
Let me take a look at his
profile so that I am in context.

245
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:48,039
So he's a founder of Urbanwork.

246
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:49,649
Oh, I see.

247
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,599
He founded a new company.

248
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:56,949
So Kalpataru.

249
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,189
Okay, I could ask him about Urbanwork,
like the company that he's working on.

250
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,009
Ideas

251
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:15,599
how are things progressing
at, I would say, Urbanwork.

252
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,559
But I would also, I
could also tag Urbanwork

253
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:24,489
and I would post it.

254
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:26,139
This is it.

255
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:29,859
So, I will talk about the the second
approach to commenting on this.

256
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:33,339
You could use ChatGPT to create an
automated comment for this and quickly

257
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:35,149
so that you can speed up the commenting.

258
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:40,269
But the manual approach is the best way to
do it so that you can add good comments.

259
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,059
But this is how you find posts in the
LinkedIn feed that have somewhat good

260
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,569
engagement and is a relevant post.

261
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:50,214
So ideally you need to be
finding relevant posts, even if

262
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:51,274
you have to scroll for a while.

263
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,014
Digital platforms and construction.

264
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:54,934
See this one, this is a relevant post.

265
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:58,774
So I would drop a comment on this, tag
this guy, drop a relevant comment, end

266
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,734
it off with a question and post it.

267
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:07,214
Now let's talk about the second type of
posts that you should be commenting on.

268
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,879
And those are Posts from
your sales navigator feed.

269
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:14,709
The next step is to go to sales navigator.

270
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:20,039
So go to sales navigator and go to
home and this is the feed for different

271
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:25,759
types of alerts for leads that you've
saved as saved searches on linkedin So

272
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,859
you need to be saving them or creating
lead lists or of of people that you

273
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:33,109
are reaching out to On linkedin.

274
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,949
So this these are people
that fit your icps.

275
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,264
So we're not just commenting on posts
on the LinkedIn feed of other creators.

276
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:44,884
We are also commenting on posts of our
ideal customer personas of the people

277
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,984
that we are targeting on LinkedIn.

278
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:49,884
And after you save them in a search,
after you save the search or save

279
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:52,764
them to a need list on, on LinkedIn.

280
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:55,274
Their feed will come in here.

281
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:59,044
So these are all the updates about all
their posts and they can be found in

282
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:00,704
the same sales navigator home screen.

283
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:04,204
If you haven't already saved a
lead list what you need to do is

284
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,324
you need to create a lead list.

285
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,424
I need to save prospects in leads.

286
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,889
This has been covered in the outreach
modules, but when you've done

287
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,989
that it'll start populating with
updates about accounts and leads.

288
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:19,579
What you should be doing is you should
click on leads to see updates from leads.

289
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,589
But what I want to show you is how easy
it is to Comment on posts from here.

290
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,969
So you can receive updates
from different leads over here.

291
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:30,659
So if you find like a relevant lead
update from a relevant lead who's

292
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:34,319
in the in the niche that you're
targeting So in our case, it's it's

293
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,459
it services and it consulting or
business consulting and services or

294
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:43,014
Construction like the case study that
that we showed we walked into earlier.

295
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:49,224
So clicked on view the view link and
Load the post directly in the sidebar

296
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:52,984
and you also have the option to comment
over here So this is how it go about

297
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:57,984
I let again tag the person who posted
so it can be a company or a lead But

298
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:01,604
what I would recommend is only focusing
on lead conversations So it's people

299
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:04,544
people should be seeing the updates
people you should be posting on people's

300
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:10,459
comments people's posts but you click
on you tag the person who posted,

301
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,899
in our case it's a company page, so
I'm just going to proceed with it.

302
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:16,479
I'm looking forward to learn more about
Scandinavian scene, so you could say

303
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:20,749
something along the lines of, you should
be attending I'm not a gift to 833, but

304
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,299
I'm just giving this to you as an example.

305
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:29,939
Looking forward to meeting there.

306
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:35,224
Been waiting.

307
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:39,704
Okay.

308
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:42,094
So I would also have something
like, what's the best way to

309
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:49,234
reach out to you or something like
when will you be in Scandinavia?

310
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:50,854
What date will you be in Scandinavia?

311
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,664
Something to build the conversation.

312
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,864
So that you receive a response and
they notice you on LinkedIn, you

313
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:57,384
receive replies to the comments.

314
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:02,244
So this is how you go about commenting
on the feed in the sales navigator

315
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:07,624
of lead updates of people who've,
that you've saved in your lead

316
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:10,074
lists in sales navigator the posts.

317
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:13,199
That they publish will come in
here as a feed and all you need

318
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,129
to do is, is click on view and
comment, drop a comment on them.

319
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,949
Now let's move on to the last
step, the last type of comments

320
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:23,069
that you should be dropping.

321
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,009
And those are comments
on influencer posts.

322
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,239
So the first step for this
is to find influencers.

323
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:35,629
Now ideally when you publish posts
on influencers, it should be at the

324
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,189
immediately after they've published.

325
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:41,589
So influencers tend to generate a lot of
comments on their posts so your comment

326
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,149
can generate a lot of brand awareness
as well, a lot of responses as well.

327
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,659
So it's important that you post
as early as possible as soon

328
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:49,949
as the influencers publish.

329
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,399
But the first step in this process is
to find the influencers and document

330
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:58,029
them so that you understand exactly
which profiles posts to comment on.

331
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:02,189
So how do you go about
finding influencers?

332
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,079
So all you need to do is use Taplio again.

333
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:07,789
Taplio was covered earlier in at the
start of the content marketing modules.

334
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:11,929
But Taplio is a tool that you can use
to search for good content pieces that

335
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,409
find, that have gone viral on LinkedIn.

336
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,369
So we set up Taplio.

337
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,969
Take a look at that video if
you'd like to take a look at it.

338
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:21,369
We do cover, we do have a video
about how to use a combination of

339
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:26,569
Taplio, ChatGPT, and LinkBoost to
create a lot of content very quickly.

340
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:27,574
Take a look at that.

341
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:31,634
We cover Taplio in detail over there,
but we go back to search mode in Taplio.

342
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:36,694
And once we are in Taplio we just
search for the specific keyword

343
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:37,924
that is related to our industry.

344
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,294
In our case, it's construction.

345
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:41,984
And then what we do is
we click on this filter.

346
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,514
button over here and we select the
minimum number of likes as 500.

347
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:48,604
The reason we do this, we want to
find influencers who are generating

348
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,044
a lot of engagement on their
content with good followings.

349
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:57,164
So set it as at least 500 and publishes
at least 60 days ago publish at most 500

350
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:59,244
two days ago and that should be enough.

351
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:03,114
Click on apply and now Taplio will find
posts that have performed really well

352
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:06,274
that are in on this topic, construction.

353
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:09,924
So let's take a look at the profiles
of the people who have published.

354
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:13,644
So if you scroll, if you like hover
over the the profile image over

355
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:17,324
here, it will show you like what
that person says and this is the

356
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,384
link to their LinkedIn profile.

357
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:21,454
So if you click over here, it
will go to their LinkedIn profile.

358
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:24,424
And it'll also give you a summary of like.

359
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:28,809
What that person does so in this case
tyler campbell is a generation of builders

360
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,539
So he's he's into construction already.

361
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:36,754
So this would be a relevant Profile
that we could look for and what you

362
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:42,244
need to be checking is The type of
engagement that is getting on his post.

363
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:45,594
So take a look at this one So not
a lot of engagement is getting like

364
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:46,964
below 10 comments for each post.

365
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:51,514
So I wouldn't regard this
as very good Influencer.

366
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,464
So I'll move on to the next person.

367
00:19:54,764 --> 00:19:58,504
So for the example, this person
is Sophie Hogan is the director

368
00:19:58,504 --> 00:19:59,684
of Hogan Homes and Development.

369
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:00,744
So I would take a look at that.

370
00:20:01,094 --> 00:20:02,884
This person is Simon Doherty.

371
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,834
He's a construction recruitment manager.

372
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:05,974
So I would take a look at that.

373
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,454
I'll move on to the next person.

374
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:11,914
So this is Mehta Soltani social
media platform, civil engineering.

375
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:12,064
Okay.

376
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,414
He's talking about construction stuff.

377
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:14,564
So let's open his profile.

378
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,264
Then take a look at this.

379
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:19,694
She is unstoppable media.

380
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:20,024
Okay.

381
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:24,704
It looks like she's a coach
in, let's take a look anyway,

382
00:20:24,944 --> 00:20:26,744
construction, irrigation stuff.

383
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,614
So let's take a look at
this profile, see who it is.

384
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:31,684
Okay.

385
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:36,114
It's not showing us the profile for
some reason, but I'll keep moving on.

386
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:37,569
Future of construction is here.

387
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,734
Let's take a look at who this is.

388
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:41,084
Successfully even more never see.

389
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:41,554
Okay.

390
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,394
Let me just take a look
at that profile anyway.

391
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:44,984
And then

392
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,564
let's take a look at that profile as well.

393
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:49,174
So we're trying to find
influencers in this manner.

394
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:52,374
So over time, if you scroll through
and like, say, you have to try

395
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:53,644
multiple variations of keywords.

396
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:56,504
You can't just select one keyword and
find all influencers in that space.

397
00:20:57,034 --> 00:21:00,494
So after you go through like
a bunch of profiles in here,

398
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,944
human resources, that's HR post.

399
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:06,714
Tracy, let's take a look at that.

400
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,054
These are all job posts.

401
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:15,024
Augmented reality, okay, not really.

402
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:15,844
Construction,

403
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:20,634
let's take a look at his profile.

404
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:30,204
Engineering and Geosys
companies reach massive.

405
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,854
Engineering companies, yes,
to an extent this is relevant.

406
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:36,754
So it may not exactly be in construction
as long as they publish good content

407
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,224
on construction, it should be fine.

408
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:41,069
Construction, again, he's
a construction creator.

409
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:43,139
So very good prospect there.

410
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:45,289
Now what I'll do is I'll go
through each of these profiles

411
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:46,219
and see if they're relevant.

412
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:50,029
So this guy is creating good
content on construction.

413
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,589
I could use this as an influencer, but
he's not generating a lot of engagement.

414
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,279
So I'm a bit skeptical over there.

415
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,389
So we'll move on.

416
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,299
She's in the construction space.

417
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,389
Oh, she's getting good engagement.

418
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,149
Look at that content.

419
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:05,219
So this is somebody I would consider,
but the first thing you need to look

420
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:10,809
at is, is checking if they have good,
relevant posts that are the type of

421
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:12,249
posts that we're looking to engage on.

422
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:21,419
So this is announcement post so this is
announcements about stuff in creating.

423
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:27,254
Okay.

424
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:28,844
This is a good creator.

425
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:31,354
Daily grind.

426
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:34,314
She's publishing like a variety
of types of content pieces.

427
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:35,844
Budget rant.

428
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:37,214
Okay.

429
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:38,304
This is a good creator.

430
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:42,904
So now what I'll do is I will make
sure that the post screen is selected.

431
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:46,914
The post screen is selected and
I will copy this URL and I'll go

432
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:48,534
to the content analysis sheet.

433
00:22:48,774 --> 00:22:49,034
Okay.

434
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,394
Your content analysis sheet.

435
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:53,694
And one of the worksheets in
the content analysis sheet is

436
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:55,164
called the influencer sheet.

437
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:55,714
All right.

438
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:58,374
So what I will do is
I will paste the post.

439
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,214
Post page URL.

440
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:00,684
Okay.

441
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:05,764
Look at the post page URL and I will
copy the name of the influencer.

442
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:09,424
So come in here, copy the name of
the influencer and I'll come in here.

443
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,014
All right.

444
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:12,954
Now there is a bit of manual
work involved in here.

445
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:15,944
After you create like a list of
influencers, you need to take

446
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:18,514
a look at, you need to figure
out when they're publishing.

447
00:23:18,554 --> 00:23:21,174
Now this is difficult because
it's difficult to understand.

448
00:23:21,184 --> 00:23:23,634
They don't exactly show the
time of posting on LinkedIn.

449
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:24,854
You need to.

450
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:28,049
Check their profile frequently
every day until you figure out

451
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,249
like at what times they post.

452
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:31,999
So you should be able to figure
out what time they're posting

453
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,989
within a margin of 30 minutes.

454
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,739
And this is a constant activity.

455
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,439
So ideally for the next few days,
you should be checking these

456
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,659
influencer profiles every day.

457
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:44,309
And if the post is published today
or like within 24 hours, you can

458
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:45,839
see like the exact hour count.

459
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,459
So 18 hours, 12 hours, et cetera.

460
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,149
So you should be able to figure out.

461
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,139
at what times they're posting.

462
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,789
Most creators publish at
the same time every day.

463
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,829
So this should be somewhat easy.

464
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:59,539
But once you figure that out, you
should be coming in here and dropping

465
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:04,539
your comment in the comments column and
saying something like she posts at 10 a.

466
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:04,849
m.

467
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:06,139
day.

468
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:10,649
So the reason we do this is because for
influencer posts, we need to comment on

469
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,709
their posts, ideally within the first 30
minutes after they publish so that the

470
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:19,239
future comments that are coming in on that
post see our comment and we generate some

471
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,909
engagement and brand awareness using that.

472
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:26,514
Alright this is not important for sales
navigator feed posts and, and posts on

473
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:30,054
your feed when you comment on them, but
this is important for influencer posts.

474
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:32,634
So the next step is to go through
like all the tabs that you've

475
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:36,664
opened with different influencers
as he's building teams for tomorrow.

476
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:39,064
He looks like in the construction
space from the cover image.

477
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,514
And take a look at the engagement.

478
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:43,404
He's getting good engagement
like likes are good.

479
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:45,374
Managing partner TLO.

480
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,514
So he, they specifically focus
on architecture, engineering

481
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:50,244
and construction firms.

482
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:52,144
So yeah, our same target audience.

483
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,914
So the content should be relevant as well.

484
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,434
So this is another guy I would consider.

485
00:24:56,934 --> 00:25:00,164
And I'll keep doing this latest
development in engineering.

486
00:25:00,184 --> 00:25:01,774
So could be relevant.

487
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:06,194
Circle building, construction industry,
alerting traffic like the forklift.

488
00:25:06,194 --> 00:25:07,104
So this is very relevant.

489
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,824
And you see the engagement is
getting, this is another good

490
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:11,744
influencer that we could use.

491
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:12,654
Corina.

492
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:14,414
So let's take a look at Corina.

493
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:17,764
Corina is I guess this
is a branding agency.

494
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:20,459
Oh, no.

495
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:22,819
CPR construction cleaning.

496
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:26,039
So she, she's created in
the construction space.

497
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:33,149
So I'm assuming that
construction cleaning.

498
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:33,579
Okay.

499
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:38,319
So she does publish some content about
construction, but not very relevant.

500
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,159
So you could take a look at the post
before making a decision, whether she's a

501
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,079
good influencer or not, but I'm moving on
to the next person creating innovation.

502
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:46,519
A few harmless.

503
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:48,114
Avalanche of destruction.

504
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,764
Google announces mind
boggling universally.

505
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:50,634
A translator tool.

506
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:52,734
Personal brand.

507
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,154
Can I be better at everything?

508
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:56,654
So not really very
relevant on construction.

509
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:59,764
So I'm going to move on to the next
person and take a look at the content.

510
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:00,734
Sponsorship.

511
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,344
No, this is not a relevant conversation.

512
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:03,564
Relevant influencer.

513
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:07,244
Mobility, freedom for people to
reduce mobility, automating it.

514
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,959
So he powers stuff about tech.

515
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:15,119
So this could be a good example for the
niche sorry, the viral influencer persona.

516
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,549
So this is a good example you can take.

517
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,389
So many of these that we saw are all
good examples of viral influencer

518
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:22,979
persona because they are getting
very good engagement on the content.

519
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,829
But for for niche persona
this is not a good example.

520
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:30,049
We need to be focusing on people in the
construction space because construction is

521
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:31,889
a case study that we are targeting, right?

522
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:33,549
So look at this.

523
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:34,389
No, not a good.

524
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:35,694
example.

525
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:41,584
So I keep doing this until I generate
a list of at least 20 influencers.

526
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:43,484
Now 20 is the number, the target number.

527
00:26:43,714 --> 00:26:48,924
So in here we need to be documenting at
least 20 people with their posts page URL.

528
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:52,244
And you need to do this for a couple
of days, check their profiles for a

529
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:55,514
couple of days until you can figure
out at what time they're posting.

530
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:58,634
So most influencers will be posting
at the same time because they're

531
00:26:58,634 --> 00:27:00,254
consistent with their content process.

532
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:02,634
And that is how they build the
followings in the first place.

533
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,194
But once you fill this out.

534
00:27:04,554 --> 00:27:08,164
You should be checking these over every
day and then taking a look at the posts

535
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,384
that they're publishing every day.

536
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:12,894
And after they publish the post of piece
of content, you should be following the

537
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:16,444
exact same commanding process that we
just walked through for sales navigator,

538
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:18,474
feed posts and your LinkedIn feed posts.

539
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:22,719
Now, that is how we find influencers
and go about and comment.

540
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:29,479
But the next step is to talk about how to
use ChatGPT for quick comment generation

541
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:32,039
for all of the different types of posts.

542
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:35,989
So any post you want to do, you can use
ChatGPT to create the comments quickly.

543
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,389
And I'm going to show you
quickly how to do that.

544
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:42,349
All right, so this is ChatGPT and
we use a very simple prompt in here,

545
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:49,959
like, I want you to create a 25 to 40
word comment for a post I sent you.

546
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,579
The tone of voice used in the comment
you generate should be that of a thought

547
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,379
leader who's an expert in construction.

548
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:58,499
So this should be personalized for
whatever your own industry is, for your

549
00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:01,140
business, whatever your industry is in
you should personalize this with that.

550
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,040
And then we say the
comment should be positive.

551
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,990
And first reference some details
mentioned in the post and then end with

552
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,610
a question about some related detail.

553
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,410
Do not include hashtags in the comment.

554
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,960
And then we say this is the post and
we drop the link to drop the post copy.

555
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,930
Just copy paste the entire post
post copy and drop it in here.

556
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:23,595
And chat GPT will create a comment for
you saying as a fellow construction

557
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:26,155
professional, I empathize with your
disappointment regarding the lack of

558
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,135
support in the recent budget streamlining.

559
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:30,025
The bureaucratic process is crucial.

560
00:28:30,105 --> 00:28:33,055
How can we ensure timely
approvals and remove obstacles

561
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:35,165
for small house builders like us?

562
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:38,735
Very easy and very easy to create.

563
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:43,395
And all I need to do now is
copy paste this into LinkedIn.

564
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:48,015
So I can go to LinkedIn and this is
the post I want to create comment on.

565
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,545
And I can click on comment.

566
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,430
And paste it in there.

567
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,600
And I can also tag the person
the creator of the post.

568
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,580
All right.

569
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,070
And click on post.

570
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,620
That's it.

571
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,930
Very simple process for creating comments.

572
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,030
If you don't want to like write the
comments manually yourself, and you

573
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,370
can do this for all kinds of posts
to generate comments very quickly.

574
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,004
So that sums up the

575
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:21,995
network activation video and this
helps us activate our existing network

576
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:27,055
on LinkedIn very quickly so that we
prime the algorithm to get more users

577
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:30,515
to see our content, engage on our
content, and quickly build a following

578
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:31,895
and start generating inbound leads.

579
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:38,825
And it's important that you set this
up quickly, especially the endorsements

580
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:43,035
and the liking post liking campaign so
that that happens in an ongoing fashion.

581
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:47,175
Every few months you can do a new sales
navigator search and add more of your new

582
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:48,815
first degree connections to that list.

583
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:53,355
So that's it for this video.

584
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,405
See you in the next video.
