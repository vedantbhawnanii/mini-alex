1
00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:05,339
So in this video, I'm going to walk you through
a structured process to identify your competitors

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:11,000
and analyze them and their content on multiple
social media platforms and their website so

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,382
that we can understand what content formats
they use, what topics they create content on

4
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:20,563
and how to document it in a good manner in the
content analysis sheet. Now why is this important?

5
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:25,004
This is important because the best way to build
the foundation to your own content strategy

6
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:29,890
is to analyze what other competitors in your
space are doing and how they're doing it. In

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,272
addition to this benefit of giving you a validated
understanding of what content works in your

8
00:00:35,312 --> 00:00:40,594
industry, it will also help your content team
in having this documented in one place so that

9
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:45,156
they can refer to it to come up with more content
ideas. The name of the sheet we use to do this

10
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:49,058
analysis is called the content analysis sheet,
and you can find it in the progress tracking

11
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:53,440
sheet and below the video. This analysis will
take about three to four hours in total to

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,478
complete fully, including watching the training.
So let's jump into it. So let's go to the content

13
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:03,581
gap analysis sheets and we have the competitor
analysis sheet in here. So the competitor analysis

14
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:07,863
sheet basically list down has a column for a
bunch of competitors, their websites, their

15
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:13,306
company pages, the key profiles of users of
their company who may be active on those profiles,

16
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:17,429
especially on LinkedIn. And then we have a list
of links to their different social media profiles.

17
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:22,992
And then the analysis begins where we analyze
their LinkedIn content, their top of the funnel

18
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:26,986
content, their middle of the funnel content,
their Bofu content and so on. so that we

19
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:32,108
can get an understanding as to what types of
content each of these competitors are creating.

20
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:39,051
Alright, now let's start off with finding competitors.
Now if you're in the consulting space, I'm

21
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:43,152
going to explain how to find your competitors
with the help of this case study. That's a

22
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:47,414
robotic process automation and process automation
company called Rhenus Automation. They're part

23
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:52,636
of a conglomerate. We work with them. So let's
take a look at how we can find some competitors

24
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:56,990
with this client. In most cases, if you're running
a consulting or a service company. you will

25
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,371
already have a very good understanding of your
major competitors like who are the big players

26
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:06,893
in the niche, who are brands, service companies,
or consulting companies that are already doing

27
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:11,854
a good job of creating content and generating
brand awareness with their content. So you

28
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:16,555
can list them down in the sheet, but in case
you need to find more competitors, you need

29
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:21,397
to do some research about this, this is the
process that you can follow for this. So the

30
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:27,071
first way to easily find other... consulting
or service companies in your space. This is

31
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:31,494
just enter the keyword for the service which
you offer, say in this case is process automation

32
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:36,837
or intelligent automation or business automation
and consulting or service and so on. And Google

33
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:42,500
will give you like a bunch of results of companies
in the space, but ideally to look at companies

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,464
that are not very big. So ideally look at companies
that are maybe up to four times your size,

35
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:54,553
but not beyond that. If it's beyond four times.
what happens is the content style and the tone

36
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:58,436
of voice will be completely different. The target
audience that they focus on will be completely

37
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:02,961
different, so they won't be a good example for
the analysis. But if I search for process automation,

38
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:08,186
I can see Bain & Company, which is very big,
EY is very big. We have a bunch of stuff in

39
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:15,813
here. And what I will do is I will scroll through
each of these. I will go through the next few

40
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:21,201
pages and try to come up with some names of
companies that are better doing a good job

41
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:29,166
over here. Now I keep doing this for a while
and I'll try to come up with a bunch of companies

42
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:36,632
that are a good fit. So I've done my work and
I've identified some competitors but in addition

43
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:41,235
to Google there are a few other places that
we need to look. So one of them is G2. So what

44
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:47,526
G2 is, it's kind of like a directory website
that lists software providers, consulting service

45
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:53,388
providers and so on. So all I did was search
for robotic process automation services and

46
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:58,849
it dropped me this page with a bunch of sub-optional
listings of different companies that offer

47
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:02,410
robotic process automation or business process
automation. And in search for more keywords

48
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,692
and I can find more. But from websites like
G2, again, we shouldn't be looking at big companies.

49
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:12,773
Say for example, Tata Consultancy Services is
one of the biggest IT companies in the world.

50
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:18,143
And it's a bad idea to take them because the
donor style of the content and their targeting

51
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:24,785
persona will be completely different from say
a startup that offers robotic process automation

52
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:30,786
or business process automation services like
Rhenus Automation or an SMB. So you should

53
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:35,968
either be looking at companies of similar size
or the same size. So all of these are very

54
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:45,353
big companies, but then I did get some good examples like 
AccelerateRPA or Aggranda and so on, Now what I would do is

55
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:50,660
go through Google as well as G2. There's one
more website that you can take a look at. So

56
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,907
that's Capterra. I'll explain Capterra in more
detail later in the video. But Capterra is another

57
00:04:56,927 --> 00:05:02,213
website that you can use to take a look at.
I need to win, find, prove that I'm a human.

58
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:09,397
So just get that load. This is frustrating.

59
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,439
Alright, we're done.

60
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,281
Okay, so we are on Capterra. And you can do
the same thing that we just did on G2. We can

61
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:36,711
search for say, robotic process automation,
services, and click enter, and they will bring

62
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:42,637
us a bunch of stuff. I got good examples like
Automation Anywhere, which I was already familiar

63
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:49,738
with, but even then you will get good results
from here. And you can... I suggest spending

64
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:54,559
a bit of time if you're not very familiar with
the industry and you need to find competitors.

65
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,500
But most of you watching this video will already
have a good understanding of who your main

66
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,942
competitors are. But it's good to do this so
that you get an understanding of which competitors

67
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:10,443
are doing a really good job of marketing their
business online with Conte. Now after you've

68
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:15,705
opened up a bunch of apps, I suggest doing this
for about 15 minutes till you come up with

69
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:21,964
15 to 20 different competitors. And please remember
that when I say competitor, I don't really

70
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:26,146
mean that they've offered the exact service
that you offer. They could be offering the

71
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:32,069
exact different kinds of service model. They
could be offering a different proposition in

72
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,311
the same sub niche or niche. They could even
be a software company, even if you are the

73
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:43,595
consulting space. But the core identifier that
we need to use over here to consider them as

74
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:47,317
a competitor is that they need to be focusing
on the same target audience with similar pain

75
00:06:47,337 --> 00:06:53,392
points. right and they need to be solving the
same pain point so for example even if we are

76
00:06:53,412 --> 00:07:01,075
a robotic process automation consulting company
UiPath which is one of the biggest RPA companies

77
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:06,398
in the world and Automation Anywhere which is
a competitor of UiPath are both software and

78
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:11,140
tools that we use for our clients to help them
automate so even though we are a consulting

79
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,100
company we may be using a bunch of softwares
that focus on the exact same target audience.

80
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,503
So in our case, I know that both UiPath and
Automation Anywhere are focusing on the exact

81
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:28,187
same target audiences as well, so I could consider
these as competitors and analyze their content

82
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:35,712
as well. So that's a good idea. But try to make
sure that they have, they're focusing on the

83
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:40,876
similar target audiences and they're solving
the same pain points that you're solving with

84
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:45,935
your product or your service. All right, so.
I have opened a bunch of tabs over here and

85
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:52,221
if you are not familiar with that brand and
like say you need to consider or evaluate them

86
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:57,285
to see if they are a good enough competitor
the best way to do this is one take a look

87
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:02,169
at the traffic that they are generating to their
website and two take a look at the number of

88
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,772
employees that they have and the number of followers
that they have on their company page. Now how

89
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:12,890
do we do this? So the best thing to do is to
use the SEOquake Chrome extension. So it's

90
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:20,877
called SEOquake. I will just open up their extension
page so that you understand how it looks. So

91
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:28,343
that's SEOquake. Just google this SEOquake Chrome
and you should be able to find the Chrome extension.

92
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:32,066
Install the Chrome extension. You don't need
to activate it or anything. Just install the

93
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:37,010
Chrome extension and when you go to any website
you can just click on this link. Select this

94
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,890
one. So just select this one and click on Semrush
SE Traffic. a very similar search engine traffic.

95
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,452
So that will give us an understanding of how
much traffic they're generating. So it seems

96
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:52,154
they're generating about 80 visitors, which
is very low. So I don't think this is a good

97
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:59,477
one, but let me also evaluate the LinkedIn page
of this user. So when you, any website you

98
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:04,460
take, if you go to the footer or to the header,
there should be social media links like this

99
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,698
one. So you can just click on that and it'll
open up the company page of these. companies

100
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:13,040
on LinkedIn, you can take a look at the number
of followers that they have and the number

101
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,105
of employees that they have. So if they're big
enough, you can take a look at the website

102
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:23,808
and also see if they have an active blog, if
they're publishing content actively. So it

103
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:31,554
looks like these guys don't seem to have a lot
of content on the website. They have some case

104
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:36,317
studies, but let me also take a look at their
company page and see their publishing posts.

105
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,611
So this is a good way to go about, let's say,
understanding if they're actively creating

106
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:45,852
content or taking a look at this. They published
the previous post like, yeah, they're publishing

107
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:52,934
it one month ago, three weeks ago, and so on.
Let me sort this by recent using this filter

108
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:56,935
over here. So they're not publishing content
very actively, so I don't think Blackbook is

109
00:09:57,255 --> 00:10:01,997
a good competitor to analyze. In this manner,
I keep going to the next one that I came across.

110
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:09,873
So VURAM is another one. See. on podcast,
they are creating some content actively. So

111
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:14,137
let's take a look at Insights. They do have
a blog. Let's take a quick look at the blog.

112
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:20,843
And let's take a look at their SEMrush traffic.
So the SEMrush traffic seems to be about, how

113
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:30,421
much is that? 213, better than the previous
one. But let's take a look at. There are social

114
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:39,258
media profiles. So they don't have a lot of
social media content. So what I would do is

115
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,864
open them up in LinkedIn. So.

116
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:58,906
VURAM. Search for VURAM. WNS VURAM. Alright they 
seem to have 913 employees, quiet big, and they have 

117
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:06,906
15000 followers Not Bad, So let's take a look at the posts
and the content on the website. And in this manner, I keep

118
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:11,906
going through all the competitors that I've, that 
I've just opened up new tabs with, and I'll just go

119
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:15,906
through them and then try to understand
if they are a good competitor that we need

120
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,965
to analyze that is creating good content. 
So just quick checks,

121
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:24,048
But that should be more than enough to understand
how and well they do. So if you take a look

122
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:27,471
at the LinkedIn page, okay, they're publishing
daily. They're attending Summit

123
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:36,057
for, one week. Okay. Not very active. Maybe
they're publishing once a week or something.

124
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:42,361
Okay. Twice a week. No pro capabilities. Okay.
They, okay. I haven't sorted it yet. So it's

125
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:48,665
sorted by recent and yeah, they are publishing
content actively.

126
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:57,327
So this is someone I will keep open to WNS VURAM
will be someone I keep open and I will keep

123
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:03,111
moving on to the next one Scalepointer is another
one again like usual we open up the LinkedIn

124
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:09,356
company page we take a look at how much traffic
they're generating to their website this was

125
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:13,640
NA which means they don't assembles doesn't
have the data so I'm taking a look at their

126
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,307
LinkedIn and their content on their company
page and try to quickly understand if they're

127
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:22,531
a good competitor or not. Now, this is how you
can do it in the consulting space. But please

128
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:30,358
remember, don't filter out competitors who may
be offering a definite business model. Now,

129
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:37,003
irrespective of whether you're in the consulting
space or the SaaS space, the actionable walkthrough

130
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:40,446
that we're going to jump into right now will
cover the entire process. You can follow the

131
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:45,438
exact same process for whether you're a consulting
company or a SaaS company. But in this case

132
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:50,781
for this video, to explain the process in detail,
I'm gonna be using a SaaS example, because

133
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:55,083
SaaS products tend to have better content so
that I can explain this better in the video,

134
00:12:55,343 --> 00:13:03,688
all right? Now TraceCost is a SaaS company in
the construction niche. They're one of our

135
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:09,451
clients. So I'm gonna be using this to give
you an example of how to go about doing this

136
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:13,653
in the SaaS space. For most of you who are in
the SaaS space, this process should work for

137
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:20,113
you. So the first step to do here in order to
identify your competitors is to list out existing

138
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:25,177
identity existing competitors that you're already
familiar with. So most of you will already

139
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:29,980
have a good idea on who your competitors are
or who are the big players of this industry

140
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,083
or creating really good content. And from my
own knowledge, I know filter trend is a very

141
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:40,707
good competitor that we should be analyzing
in this industry. But if you're not familiar

142
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:44,454
with like a lot of competitors in your industry
and you want to do additional research. We

143
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:51,181
should be doing this for at least three or four
competitors. But in order to go about doing

144
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:57,148
this and finding additional competitors, an
easy way to do this is to use Capterra. So Capterra

145
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,072
is a website that well shows you.

146
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:10,058
a lot of alternatives to a specific software.
So you can just search for one competitor,

147
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:16,784
name it, then Capterra in Google, and just
open it. And this should give you suggestions

148
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:23,770
for alternatives you can use. So if I just keep
scrolling down, I can find some construction

149
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,114
workforce management. So this is a good one
that I can look at. And there's Autodesk Construction

150
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,937
Cloud. So that's another good one I can look
at. I can just open this in a new tab, CoConstruct.

151
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,987
There's a bunch of them, construction jobs on
track, this is also a good one. Contractor

152
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:43,248
Foreman, this is also a good one. Fieldwire
construction scheduling software, this is also

153
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:48,590
a good one. So I read through the alternatives
and I try to get an understanding of which

154
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,491
of the relevant ones in my industry that are
targeting the same target audience that I have.

155
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:57,652
It's not important that they have, they've offered
the exact same products and services as well

156
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:02,622
as they offer solutions and services or products
to the same target audience. that is similar

157
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:07,826
to your product or service, you can consider
them as a competitor. All right, and from this

158
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:12,009
research that I've already done, I've identified
a bunch of competitors. So the first one is

159
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:16,752
the Autodesk Construction Cloud. So I will
go back to the sheet. I will add that in here.

160
00:15:16,812 --> 00:15:24,117
Let me follow that correctly. And I'll keep
going till I add this. So I also identified

161
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:29,661
the website for them. So I'm gonna come in here
and I've added the competitor website URL.

162
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:36,265
on and then keep doing this activity. So BuildPro

163
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:46,467
Okay, looks like I'm unable to find home builder
software. Okay The essential construction management

164
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:53,529
software cool. This looks like the correct one.
So I'm gonna open them in here So CoConstruct

165
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:59,051
I've just googled them. They have a website
Pro Crew Schedule their website so

166
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:05,433
I could burn and look at that build it Oops
sorry, okay, build it is not that build it.

167
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:14,823
I can just maybe so truck constructional software
and I should be able to get an idea. Yeah,

168
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:22,272
I think this looks like the correct website.
So I'm going to open that and copy the URLs

169
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:29,781
of all the ones I find in here. All right, so
I'm adding that and

170
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:40,857
the troll. A piece that we hear. And then we
have full construct. And a that we have here.

171
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:51,113
then we have a Pro Crew schedule so I'm gonna
copy the tech wordpress and add that in here

172
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:07,440
and the trend is going to be this URL. Now that
I named. So now I found five competitors. Now,

173
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,002
ideally you should be selecting the best, the
biggest five competitors, so that all of them

174
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:18,343
have active content strategies that they're
using that they get to learn from. But the

175
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:21,984
best way to do this, you should take a look
at the software as you will already have an

176
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:25,745
idea on who these competitors could be. So you
can just list it down. You don't need to do

177
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:29,499
additional research using Capterra. But if you
don't have a good idea, just take a look at

178
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,622
their website, see how many users they have,
see if they have a content strategy, and the

179
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:38,845
ones that seem like the biggest businesses,
add them in here. All right, the next step

180
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:44,189
is to add the LinkedIn profiles and the social
media profiles of all of these different softwares.

181
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:51,454
And the best place to find this is, again, in
the other websites themselves. So you can open

182
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:57,886
up each of these websites one by one, and you
can easily scroll down. to the bottom and in

183
00:17:57,947 --> 00:18:01,269
the footers of most of these websites you should
be able to find the different social media

184
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:07,334
profiles. So I can easily find the Instagram
ID, the Facebook ID, the LinkedIn ID, the Twitter

185
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:14,300
ID and the YouTube ID is in here. So this is
the best way to go ahead and add URLs. So I'll

186
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:20,505
come in here and I will copy-paste all of the
URLs that I find in here. You can also open

187
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:26,500
them up because we're going to be doing some
analysis on them shortly and keep... doing

188
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,673
this activity. I'm gonna add the competitor
LinkedIn page in here.

189
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:40,289
I'm now copying Twitter.

190
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:46,457
and I'm gonna copy Youtube.

191
00:18:54,774 --> 00:19:00,279
All right, now we've added all the social media
links and the next step after this is to go

192
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:08,406
to the LinkedIn profile and add the key profiles,
stand some key profiles of users who are working

193
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:13,291
at these companies on LinkedIn, who are active,
are someone active on LinkedIn. Now, how do

194
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:21,830
we go about doing this? So we first open up
LinkedIn and we search. we can open this company

195
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,174
page on LinkedIn. So let me open up this company
page on LinkedIn. We can find it in here. And

196
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:33,899
in here, I can find that they have 793 employees.
That's quite a lot. So I can enter, I can click

197
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:40,644
on this button over here. That's a bunch of
my messages opening up. So I can add a bunch

198
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:47,229
of these, open this up in here and get an idea
of the employees who are working in that company.

199
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:52,328
Alright, so we have the Chief Strategy Officer.
Anything with Chief is something that I would

200
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:56,851
look at. So I'll just open up his profile. He's
the founder, looks seems to be the founder.

201
00:19:57,231 --> 00:20:02,694
But the easy way to go about filtering for this
is to click on Search with Sales Navigator.

202
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:08,858
And in there you can filter for the seniority
level. So ideally we should be looking at the

203
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:15,642
CXO levels at the start and try to identify
some key profiles in that company. and then

204
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:19,946
look at the VP level, then at the director level
and so on. So you should go by this in steps.

205
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:28,774
So let's first go to Sales Navigator and search
for the CXO roles in this company. In the meantime,

206
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:33,257
I can quickly look at the profiles and try to
see if they are active. So the way to find

207
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:39,223
the content that they publish is to go to the
bottom and click on Show All Activities. So

208
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:42,325
we click on Show All Activities, you should
be able to connect the posts that they publish.

209
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:51,289
He seems to be head of fintech and digital banking.
So I wouldn't see his key profile, but either

210
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:59,154
way we'll click on show all activity. He's the
founder at Buildertrend, so I'll open his profile

211
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:04,116
and then click on posts in each of these profiles.
The posts will show you the posts that they're

212
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:04,617
publishing.

213
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:12,481
On right, so looks like Buildertrend is a quite
co-constructed. That's an interesting observation.

214
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:18,660
But when I look at this profile, I can see that
the previous post was two years ago. So this

215
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,862
person is non-active. So I'm gonna close off
this profile. This person is also not active.

216
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:26,743
Okay, let's take a look at that. This person
is also not active. He's probably three years

217
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:33,867
ago, so I'm gonna close that off. This person
is sharing stuff like five months ago. So again,

218
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:40,189
not very active. I'm gonna close this off. And
now in Sales Navigator, let me take a look

219
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:45,252
at... the seniority levels. So I'm going to
click on see all filters, click on seniority

220
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:51,796
levels and I'm going to add CXOs. So CXOs would
be the first key profiles that I look at. So

221
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:56,859
I've already looked at some of these guys, but
I'm going to open this person, achieve revenue

222
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:04,664
officer. Ideally, we need to be looking at the
financial officer. We will need somebody who

223
00:22:04,764 --> 00:22:11,937
is the CMO. So now I've looked at all the CXOs.
I'm going to remove the CXO job title and look

224
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:18,542
at the VPs. So you go out of this in this step,
so this is the WISE system of customer success.

225
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:27,889
I put open his profile, I could look at SVP of
operations, EVP of marketing, engineering operations,

226
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:33,694
architecture, software development. This is
just so I can get an understanding of who's

227
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:39,070
active on LinkedIn by just quickly going through
each of these profiles. This is a wise person

228
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,291
to people, but if they don't have an active
profile in me, then that's a signal that it's

229
00:22:42,351 --> 00:22:48,394
not a good profile to look at it. So let's take
a look at this person and try to get an understanding

230
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:55,497
of whether they're active on LinkedIn, but you
won't be able to see this over here. So you

231
00:22:55,537 --> 00:23:00,699
need to open up their profile on LinkedIn, click
on this Tab icon here, and click on View

232
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:08,526
LinkedIn profile. So I'm going to do that for
all the profiles that we just saw. So, we're

233
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:17,392
open View LinkedIn profile, without this View LinkedIn
profile, I've gone this View LinkedIn. Profile,

234
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:26,588
gone this View LinkedIn profile. So I'm just gonna
go ahead and open all the LinkedIn profiles.

235
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:33,339
There, now I've opened up all the LinkedIn profiles.
I'm gonna click on Show All Activity in all

236
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:41,061
of them and then go to posts in each of these
profiles so that I can get an understanding

237
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:47,263
of the content that they're publishing and quickly
just close the tabs where there are no posts

238
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:52,625
published. All right, so many of these people
are not really active on LinkedIn. They're

239
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:57,006
getting some PR mentions. Okay, that's some
good to know. But if I take a look at this,

240
00:23:57,086 --> 00:24:01,567
many of these people have just published stuff
2 or 3 years ago Not really active on LinkedIn

241
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:09,709
This gives me an idea that, okay, this competitor
is not really active on LinkedIn This person,

242
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:14,391
she's the EVP of marketing so I guess she's
a bit more active on LinkedIn They publish

243
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:21,873
some content on social media, she's resharing
that This is a blog post that she said, okay,

244
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:27,771
but not very active But I've gotten a quick
overview on What she's doing in here, so I'm

245
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:33,634
gonna look at more profiles Cool, this is one
year before this was three months before I

246
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:39,558
get this person seems to be a bit more active
And this person is also not very active. So

247
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:44,901
now I'm gonna take a look at the content on
each of those profiles So it's gonna be three

248
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:52,045
months ago BuilderTrend company looking to grow
a team. So to the hiring post this kind of

249
00:24:52,085 --> 00:25:00,249
like employee experience story or a company
culture story. So if you take a look at that,

250
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:07,997
available homes, so many builders. So she traveled
a bit something, so she's updating on that.

251
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:18,875
This one was an event that they attended. Builders
wanted to work simpler on construction pros

252
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,478
trust to help them succeed in every aspect of
their business. So there's a blog post that

253
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:27,962
they shared on social media. All right. But
that's about it. Not as huge, um, not a lot

254
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:32,126
of activity that we can learn from, but now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a

255
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:36,590
look at the content on the company page. So
I'm just trying to form thoughts around, um,

256
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:43,095
what these, um, what this company is doing on
LinkedIn and what the user profiles are so

257
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:47,883
that I can get a validated understanding of
what works. And then I took our posts on the

258
00:25:47,903 --> 00:25:51,748
company page and again see the company page
content looks like they're publishing every

259
00:25:51,788 --> 00:26:02,291
day and they seem to have They seem to be Interesting.
Okay, so the interview attending podcasts.

260
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:09,346
That is an interesting observation. This is
a customer experience, sorry. So Shelter Solutions

261
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:11,149
LNC seems to be their customer.

262
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:22,565
data that I've seen in addition to supply chain
issues remaining continuing at Borage of Labor,

263
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:24,508
even apply three I think, gentlemen.

264
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:38,653
Interesting. So they've also linked to something
in here. Let's take a look at what that is.

265
00:26:44,182 --> 00:26:49,190
Alright so this is the announcement for a lead
magnet that they created on the construction

266
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:55,901
outlook in 2023. And they've announced it on
LinkedIn. This is seems to be.

267
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:06,609
and link to a blog post this is also a link
to a blog post this is a video

268
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,660
Let's take a look at what that is, stay right
over me.

269
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:29,387
how to pick the right clients for your business.
Interest takes, this is a blog post again on

270
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:36,194
the Buildup Trend website that is hand-privileged
to their customers. Cool. Now I have a very

271
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:41,380
good understanding on, on like say how these
users are filling it out. So I'm gonna go ahead

272
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:52,247
and open my. competitor analysis sheet, and
there are many key profiles that are actively

273
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:55,590
publishing really good content, so I'm not going
to go ahead and fill it. You can go ahead and

274
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:04,777
fill it, but I will start to enter what some
stuff I found. So LinkedIn content specifically,

275
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:14,305
some interesting posts I found were on the company
page. So they are adding customer experience

276
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:22,085
stories. So this looks like this, this I believe
is a smaller version of their website or something

277
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:26,607
they shared a blog post that they shared on
their website. They've included a link to it

278
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:30,569
which is not a very good idea but what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna copy this, I'll be linked to

279
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:39,172
this post, come to the sheet and this is an
example of a good post. I'm gonna add more

280
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:46,629
examples in here. You can label this as well,
so this is a customer experience study.

281
00:28:56,706 --> 00:29:06,939
Yeah. Right. Let's add more. This is sort of
like announcement for lead magnet. So these

282
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,621
guys are publishing lead magnets as well.

283
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:21,260
Let's look at more that they've published over
this week. They're sharing links to blog posts,

284
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:27,788
plus they're sharing snippets. Take a look,
this is a one minute video. So this is a snippet

285
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:35,717
from a podcast, a video podcast that they did.
So that is something we could add. Video content

286
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:44,266
is always a good. inclusion. I'm going to copy
the link to that and I'm going to add that

287
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:54,857
as a video podcast Snippet. So you see, just
from a few minutes of work, we have an idea

288
00:29:54,937 --> 00:30:03,604
of the content pieces that they're doing. And
now we just need to document the content formats

289
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:10,368
that they're using. Let me just fill that out.
All right, so the content formats that they're

290
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:18,711
using are customer experience stories, lead
magnets, and video port So I'm just gonna

291
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:26,451
quickly enable them or copy them from what I
find in here, customer experience story, sorry,

292
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:34,759
I'm bad at typing. Alright, and then we have
lead magnets, which is another one I could

293
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:44,230
add. Video podcast snippets are another one
I could add. Alright, and they're also sharing

294
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,253
links to blog posts. And then the counter.

295
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:58,854
All right, now what is the tone of voice that
they're using on LinkedIn? So this is a very

296
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:08,782
important element to look at. So they're mostly
looking for company, business focused content.

297
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:15,167
So all of them is business focused. They're
not really looking at the experience side or

298
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:23,378
humor or any emotional highs in the content.
It's almost always highly professional. and

299
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:24,492
business focused content.

300
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:51,789
Interesting. Okay, so this is what I will include.
We use a

301
00:31:57,494 --> 00:32:08,341
um, they use business focused on tone of voice,
um, and head, head for it.

302
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:18,227
target onions? that.

303
00:32:23,114 --> 00:32:38,045
on thoughts about how that for not to is helping
users, helping customers, or how they are events

304
00:32:38,446 --> 00:32:48,313
they attend on funding that they fulfill.

305
00:32:52,002 --> 00:33:02,010
All right, so I've filled that out. And now
I can go ahead and enter the analysis part

306
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:07,334
for the ToFu, MoFu, and BoFU content. Now,
before we proceed with this specific, these

307
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:13,119
columns, let me give you an idea of what they
mean by ToFu content. So ToFu content means

308
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:20,405
top of the funnel content. What that stands
for is content used to generate awareness.

309
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:25,055
about their product or service. So these can
be blog posts that are short form, awareness

310
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:30,316
focus pieces. These can be LinkedIn posts that
are awareness focused, viral videos, news and

311
00:33:30,336 --> 00:33:37,038
trends. These could be simple videos focused
on YouTube, on Instagram, on Reels and so on.

312
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:41,399
So now we need to take a look at all of this
analysis and make some notes on how they're

313
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:47,541
going about doing this. Now this is important
because not all content will be focused on

314
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:53,584
generating awareness. Some content will be focused
on generating, like say, focus on sharing their

315
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:59,128
expertise, which can be in-depth blog posts,
strategies, or how to focus on the blog posts,

316
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:02,910
white papers, so they're creating some white
papers and so on, then they're creating a bunch

317
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:07,474
of middle of the final content. Could be e-books,
it could be webinars, it could be podcasts,

318
00:34:07,494 --> 00:34:12,277
it could be newsletters that they're publishing
and so on. Or they could be bottom of the final

319
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:17,421
content. So bottom of the final content are
more targeted towards people who already know

320
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:22,908
and like and trust them. and they are focused
on converting them up with case studies or

321
00:34:22,948 --> 00:34:27,111
testimonial videos or demos and free consultation
calls. So those customer experience stories

322
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:32,715
that we saw fall into this category. So now
we're going to go ahead and add some examples

323
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:37,278
of each of these. So from the research that
we already did, we also need to take a look

324
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:40,940
at the social media profiles, but from the research
that we already did on LinkedIn, now we can

325
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,924
start categorizing them into ToFu, MoFu and
BoFu content. Now this is the end of the corporate

326
00:34:46,944 --> 00:34:51,339
data analysis for say Builder Trend. and you'll
have to replicate this process for Autodesk,

327
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:55,801
BuildPro, CoConstruct and Pro Crew . Now I'm
gonna go ahead and show you how you go about

328
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:59,923
doing this. So let's start off with taking a
look at blog posts that they're publishing

329
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:07,086
on their website. So I'm gonna open their website
from here, click on that, it's gonna open up

330
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:13,209
their website. And from the website, I can quickly
take a quick look and understand, okay, that's

331
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:19,877
weird. So I'm opening up for some reason, and
we just opened up from fall.

332
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:31,467
All right, so again here we have resources,
so blog, ebooks, everything. Most of the stuff

333
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:38,571
is in a structured manner. So we can already
understand, let's say, from established players,

334
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:42,692
established competitors, what are the different
types of font that they're creating. So the

335
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:46,134
first piece we need to take a look at a blog
post, right, so we're going to open the blog

336
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:50,736
and try to get an understanding of what kind
of font that they publish, all right? Now take

337
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:55,862
a look at this, construction materials management.
Okay, that is an interesting topic. on solving

338
00:35:55,922 --> 00:36:01,324
employee turnover in construction. This word,
how to guides on how to do different stuff,

339
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:06,146
how to improve construction cash flow. And by
top digital marketing strategies, I believe

340
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:11,068
that's for construction companies, how to track
construction equipment easier. So there's a

341
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:16,130
bunch of blog posts in the apparatus, see the
old post that they've published, that's interesting.

342
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:21,372
But these are in-depth guides, these are how
to track construction equipment easier. So

343
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:26,711
these are in-depth guides that are quite long.
that explain how to use I believe the builder

344
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:34,551
trends software to track construction equipment.
So we have the videos on LinkedIn right here,

345
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:43,453
but now we need to go ahead and open up the
social media profiles on Instagram, Facebook

346
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:49,635
and so on. So if you take a look at that this
column that specifically in let's say the YouTube

347
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:55,937
channels and Twitter channels we can easily
open them up to get an understanding of what

348
00:36:55,977 --> 00:37:01,555
they're doing on different social media platforms.
I'm gonna go ahead and open all of these up.

349
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:07,640
Store where there's one more, that's Instagram.
And now let's take a look at what kind of video

350
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:13,224
content they publish on all these other platforms.
All right, so I can easily come in here and

351
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:18,247
I can just scroll down to get an understanding
of what they're doing. This is something that

352
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:22,210
I noticed on the LinkedIn page as well, so it
looks like they're repurposing their LinkedIn

353
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,053
content to their Facebook content. I'm gonna
keep going. I remember seeing this as well

354
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:31,664
on their LinkedIn. This is well of their LinkedIn
so looks like they're repurposing the same

355
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:36,307
content that they're publishing on LinkedIn
to their Facebook page now let's move on to

356
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:45,112
their Instagram page and I see similar a similar
trend on Instagram as well I'm pretty sure

357
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:49,895
from the follower count on their Instagram page
that they're primarily publishing on Instagram

358
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:54,690
and Then they're republishing the content on
their LinkedIn page Let's take a look at this

359
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,210
to make sure. So this is the same content in their 
instagram page as well. You may see this trend for, for a

360
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:09,210
lot of competitors that you analyze. This was also published 
on their, on their LinkedIn. This is a re share of their LinkedIn.

360
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:17,010
Sorry re share of their blog post. Then we have blog
post again. This is a customer experience story.

360
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,710
So it looks like they're publishing more or less the
same things.


360
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,756
on different social media platforms. And finally,
we go to YouTube. So YouTube is a very good

361
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:31,464
place to get an understanding of what are events,
what are videos they're publishing. So you

362
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:41,038
can click on videos in here. And in videos,
you can get a very good understanding of What

363
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:44,640
they published is that they have something called
BuilderTrend University. That's interesting.

364
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,963
I'm going to click on videos and then Opular
to get an understanding of their best videos.

365
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:56,268
Less stress and more success. This looks like a VSL
video, like a video sales letter. I could take

366
00:38:56,288 --> 00:38:59,291
a look back just to get an understanding of
what this is.

367
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:15,637
So that is something that I could add in the
content gap analysis sheet. So I'm going to

368
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:21,080
move to the specific column where we need to
add stuff about videos that are awareness focused.

369
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:28,425
So this is awareness focused explainer videos.
I'm going to add that and hyperlink it in here.

370
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:36,129
Um, that's done. Move on back to YouTube and
try to get an understanding of what other stuff

371
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:42,521
they do. new web episode series, essential features,
or not very interesting, re-use of episode

372
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:46,924
series. So this is more of middle of the funnier
content where they're explaining about their

373
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:52,028
products, solutions, like features and so on.
So not really important, I'm just gonna keep

374
00:39:52,068 --> 00:40:02,395
looking at specific formats where they're generating
awareness about their product. These are all

375
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:08,011
features, manage all product videos. Okay, this
is again, looks like a video, interesting video

376
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:15,015
about them, so let's take a look at that. Does
your project schedule look like this? Are documents

377
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:19,618
hard to find and fill their trunk and straight
line your jobs from day one to the track with

378
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:24,642
reduced risks with detailed bumps and impressed
clients by keeping them informed. That's project

379
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:30,566
management done. So this is more like 
video sales letter that they have, but this

380
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:36,566
is also focused on awareness, 
but let's take a look

381
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:42,175
at the content sheet and let me include this
one as in there. So I'm gonna add this as a

382
00:40:42,215 --> 00:40:50,384
VSL or a video sales letter I'll fill that up for you.
So this is typically that they used to send

383
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:54,125
the prospects. and generate awareness

384
00:40:54,746 --> 00:41:00,733
So let's go back and let's see.
Okay, they have something called the building

385
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:05,077
code templates why we love them and why you
should do so the building code I believe that

386
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:08,120
starting to think that there are a series of
videos.

387
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:18,754
Part 2 of 5, Product Update, Home Depot Integration,
Quick Win Scan Receipts, Building Code Episode,

388
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:19,656
okay so this is more like a...

389
00:41:38,483 --> 00:41:41,504
I'm going to search for the building code on
YouTube and try to get an understanding of

390
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:49,650
more videos. So this seems to be the building
code podcast and Let's see the plainness. So

391
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,193
here we can see, okay, it looks like this is
the podcast that they upload on YouTube and

392
00:41:54,213 --> 00:42:02,317
they're generating a lot of awareness using
this. So this is a perfect example of what

393
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:09,502
we can add to the awareness video stage. So
I'm just going to add the building code

394
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:18,366
video podcast series. Right? And I am going
to hyperlink that to this playlist that I just

395
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:23,310
found with all the videos of it. All right?
Notice how you can come across really good

396
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,893
content formats that they're using that are
generating awareness for them. Now let's move

397
00:42:27,993 --> 00:42:31,576
on to the in-depth blog post. So we already
took a look at the website, and we came across

398
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:38,521
a bunch of blog posts that they're using to
generate awareness on the website. So this

399
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:42,684
one, for example, is about how to track construction
and make it easier. And this is an in-depth

400
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:50,241
blog post that talks about how BuilderTrend.
allows them to do it. So I am going to include

401
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:57,228
this one in here. I'm gonna paste the title
and I'm gonna copy the URL and hyperlink it.

402
00:42:57,248 --> 00:43:03,914
All right, we're done with that. And I'm gonna
keep looking at the other ones I found. So

403
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:08,158
this is the other blog post that we found earlier.
It's about construction materials management

404
00:43:08,178 --> 00:43:13,170
best practices. Again, see this is a short blog
post and not really in depth. This one is a

405
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,834
bit more in depth, stop using construction workers,
but again, not in depth as in depth as a guide.

406
00:43:17,854 --> 00:43:21,657
I'm going to close that off. How to manage and
improve construction cash flow. Okay, look

407
00:43:21,677 --> 00:43:29,864
at this. This is more in depth with a lot of
helpful stuff in the yard. They've included

408
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:38,051
lead magnets. Again, this is something that
I would include in in-depth videos that talks

409
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:42,615
about like how to strategy actionable walkthroughs
and so on. All right. So I'm going to copy

410
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:53,371
paste the topic in here. And I'm going to hyperlink
