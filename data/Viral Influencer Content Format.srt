1
00:00:01,682 --> 00:00:06,384
In this video, we're going to be covering all
the viral influencer content personas, which

2
00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:13,307
includes viral images or memes. Then we have
viral infographics and then we have viral videos.

3
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:18,469
We'll be covering viral tweets, which is also
included in this content format in this content

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,991
persona in a separate video. But in this video,
we're going to be covering all these three

5
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:28,673
content formats. But before that, let's do a
recap of what the viral influencer persona

6
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:36,307
is. In the LinkedIn Growth Campus, if you scroll
to the viral content marketing system, there

7
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:42,573
is a lesson called content strategy and team.
If you expand that, one of the videos was on

8
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:47,198
how to choose your content persona and select
content formats to build a content calendar.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,364
One of the content personas that we covered
in that lesson is that of the viral influencer

10
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:59,040
persona. The main goal of the viral influencer
persona is to generate brand awareness as much

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,843
as possible using the content that they publish
and generate a large following irrespective

12
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:09,366
of what the niche is or the industry is or the
topics of the content are. So unlike the niche

13
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:14,849
expert persona or the viral news guy persona,
they do not focus on publishing content on

14
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,391
a specific topic or a specific set of topics
or a specific industry. It can be anything.

15
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:25,003
So perfect example of this content persona is
Daniel Abrahams. So, Daniel Abrahams has been

16
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:29,626
publishing for about four years now on LinkedIn
actively. He publishes about four posts a day.

17
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:35,570
Almost, all of them are on very, very different
topics. Almos never original content. So, all

18
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,093
of these are content pieces that he borrows
from elsewhere, that he sources from other

19
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:45,437
platforms, but he borrows them from other platforms
and publish them or repurposes them onto his

20
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:51,661
profile with or without source attribution.
But this sums up what a viral influencer persona

21
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:59,603
is. All they focus on is finding posts that
have already performed well online and repurposing

22
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:05,006
them for their LinkedIn. If you go through this,
look at this. This is a quote by an actor.

23
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:10,390
This is a conversation between an H.R. and
a boss. This is what we call a viral tweet.

24
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:18,018
This is again a viral tweet with a different
format. This is... A random meme that he found

25
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:22,981
online. This is again a tweet again a tweet
This is a video that he found online, which

26
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:28,203
is about let's take a look for it Which is about
I don't know some sort of play that they're

27
00:02:28,223 --> 00:02:36,186
doing or I believe This is um, yeah, this is
a show being recorded somewhere or an illusion

28
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:43,670
Um, this is a poll. This is again a meme. So
you see this so all of these constitute content

29
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,854
formats that we can use for the viral influencer
persona. Take a look at Daniel Abraham's profile,

30
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:54,719
you'll get a better idea on what types of content
can be included and where we can find these

31
00:02:54,759 --> 00:03:00,884
content pieces from. But now, I'm going to walk
you through some sources where you can find

32
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:06,428
these content formats for each of those content
formats that we just discussed. So, the first

33
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:10,852
content format we're going to be talking about
are viral images. So, this is an example of

34
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:19,502
a viral image post. that was published by Daniel.
So take a look at this. This is about the actor,

35
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:24,366
Hollywood actor, Keanu Reeves and how he's a
kind human being. Definitely sourced online,

36
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:28,089
founded on other platforms or other social media
platforms and he just whipped up a post copy

37
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:34,334
for it and he published it and look at the engagement.
Or we could look at infographics, which is

38
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:39,217
the next content format. So infographics are
data represented visually to prove a point.

39
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:45,185
You can find infographics on lots and lots of
different sources. Just Google statistics with

40
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:50,027
any keyword you want and you can find infographics
and images on Google Images. But there's an

41
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:55,270
image on how when it's too late to change career,
the failure date. So he's proving a point with

42
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,253
that. The next content format I can talk about
are memes. Take a look at how we blocked people

43
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:04,876
in 1980s and the picture of an old phone. He
found this meme from an online website as well.

44
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:10,815
This is also from an online website. and we
have viral videos of videos that he founds

45
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:16,118
from other social media profiles and he just
drops like one line with the social attribution

46
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:21,181
of where he found the video. So, this is all
there is to it with viral influencer personas.

47
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:27,464
It is one of the easiest personas you can adopt
if you want to quickly create content and just

48
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:33,768
focus on building a following. But now we are
going to talk about a couple sources that you

49
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:36,109
can use to find good posts

50
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:43,720
the viral influence of us or not. And this includes
the different content formats. The first content

51
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,341
format I want to talk about are memes because
memes performed really well on most social

52
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:52,564
media platforms. So let's take a look at some
very good sources for memes. So the first source

53
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:58,286
I want you to talk about is memes.com. So that's
M-E-M-E-S.com. We'll drop a link in the description,

54
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:02,588
but in memes you can come in here and you can
search for any keyword, for example, construction,

55
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:07,759
and you can enter like a, get a bunch of. sources
for construction and it's an infinite load.

56
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:13,242
You can keep scrolling down until you find a
really good meme that you can find is appropriate.

57
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:19,145
You can also find a like on for this denoting
the social proof of how well that meme could

58
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:26,849
perform. Find a good meme and use it and just
repurpose it. You can get ChatGPT to create

59
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:31,912
a quick description. Just tell them, okay, this
is a meme I'd like you to do. This is a meme

60
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:32,792
on a specific topic.

61
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:41,422
word post description for this or post copy
for this and just whip it out. It doesn't matter

62
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:47,007
like what length you add for the post copies
for viral influencer because the main goal

63
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:52,632
is to find posts that have already performed
well online and that can be the main focus

64
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:57,075
of the post. So almost all of these have media
with them. There are very few text posts that

65
00:05:57,115 --> 00:06:04,341
we can see for Daniel's profile, for example.
It's all images or videos or tweets or memes

66
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:10,896
and so on. So don't focus too much on the post
copy. Almost all of them, almost all of this

67
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:15,859
post have like single line or two line post
copies. That should be more than enough for

68
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,602
a post. So either if you want to create a longer
one, you can use chargegpd or you can just

69
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:28,446
type out a line for each of the posts. All right,
so meme.com is the first source. This is specifically

70
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:35,330
for memes. Another one that you can use is supermeme.ai,
that's S-U-P-E-R-M-E-M-E.ai. and this is a

71
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,734
tool that you can use to create memes of your
own. This is an AI meme generator. All you

72
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:48,359
need to do is type something like, just got
a raise from the boss and click on generate

73
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,043
and it's going to generate some memes for you.
These are an easy way to generate memes. The

74
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:58,646
tool has a free plan. You can generate about
more than 50 memes every month using that.

75
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:03,889
That should be more than enough. This is a very
good source for finding and creating memes.

76
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:13,265
The next source I want to talk about is 9Gag.
So 9Gag is a comedy website. They post funny

77
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:17,047
content on it. And you can come in here and
you can use the search option to search for

78
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:24,970
a specific keyword and you can find names, videos,
et cetera, that is really performed well. And

79
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,692
you can also find like the import count on 9Gag.
And 9Gag is mostly like a social media platform,

80
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,950
but it's kind of like a forum where people can
post different stuff. There's a lot of traffic

81
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,173
coming into the website. So there's a lot of
engagement on the content and you can find

82
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:44,496
Posts that have performed really well so you
can see this is about 2,200 upwards 1,700 upwards

83
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:49,519
This one got 16,000 upwards. So there must be
something good about this video. It's about

84
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:56,743
construction, which is a keyword that I entered
over here But I hope you are all good here

85
00:07:56,763 --> 00:08:05,214
This Okay, this is about China's manufacturing
being below a dam That's a funny one. 9Gag

86
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:11,856
is a very good source for videos, memes, images.
You don't come find a lot of text content on

87
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:18,718
here but videos, memes and images. 9Gag is
a very good source that you can use. The next

88
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:25,200
three sources are basically the social media
platforms. The first one is YouTube. Now YouTube

89
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,590
makes this content format, creation of this
content format very easy. for the simple reason

90
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,151
that you can enter like any keywords. I can
just enter something like viral construction.

91
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:39,192
Okay. I can enter viral construction. I click
on filters and I click on under four minutes

92
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:43,513
because we don't want very long videos for viral
influencers. Ideally it should always be, videos

93
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:48,755
should be always below four minutes. So I click
on four minutes and I sort by the view count.

94
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:53,756
That is all I do. And what I get are posts that
have generated millions and millions of views

95
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:58,137
for different kinds of stuff. So this post has
performed like 164 million views and it's a

96
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:04,495
shot. It's like... I don't know, 30 seconds
long. So this is a very easy way to find videos

97
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:09,597
on every single topic under the sun because
YouTube is the biggest video platform in the

98
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:15,339
world. And you can find videos on virtually
every topic and you can find shorts. And you

99
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:21,901
can search for them as well. Now, in addition
to YouTube, you can also use platforms like

100
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:27,275
Instagram. But on Instagram, the way you go
about it is you search for the hashtags. So

101
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:32,336
the URL looks somewhat like this, but you just
open up your Instagram app and search for a

102
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:36,737
specific keyword like construction, and you
can find a lot of posts about construction.

103
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:41,719
And you keep scrolling through until you find
a good post that is relevant enough to be published

104
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,220
on your profile. Then you can either copy the
existing... You can either copy the existing

105
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,062
post copy, just put it into ChatGPT and ask
ChatGPT to rewrite this. You can even define

106
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:58,805
the number of characters in ChartGPT. This is
an easy way to go about doing this. Or you

107
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:03,268
can just whip up a one- to two-line post-copy
if you don't want to spend a lot of time into

108
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:08,351
the post-copy element. Now, see, the general
rule of thumb is that keeping your post-copy

109
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:16,536
in between 1,200 and 1,700 characters is the
best way to go about doing it. But the truth

110
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:22,387
is, viral influencer posts are so easy to create.
that you can easily publish three to four posts

111
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:28,930
every single day. And the focus over here is
more on the volume and finding content that

112
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,072
performed the best as opposed to the quality
of the content itself. So you're not focusing

113
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:38,594
about being too authentic or creating content
on your own. All you need to focus on is finding

114
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:43,876
really good sources on all these different platforms.
You can find really good publishers on YouTube

115
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:48,103
that publish the exact type of videos that you
want. or you can find really good creators

116
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:53,707
on Instagram who publish the exact type of content
that you want and keep following them and repurpose

117
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:58,350
their content with or without source attribution
onto LinkedIn. The best way is to give source

118
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,335
attribution in this manner. So I can just show
you a couple examples where source attribution

119
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:11,443
has been given properly. Say like. This one,
see this one line over here, that is the source

120
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,885
attribution is given. So it's good to give source
attribution in this manner. You don't even

121
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:19,908
need to tag them or link them. You just need
to mention the name of the company. And you

122
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:25,931
can even keep this contextual. So for example,
if we take a look at the latest Daniel Abrahams

123
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:32,575
post, this is an ad pushed out by Apple and
all he did was Apple transfers a boring sustainable

124
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:38,166
report into storytelling code. So it was an
ad and all they did was just publish it. just

125
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:42,829
mention Apple's name and that's more source
attribution. That's more than enough for source

126
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:50,394
attribution. That's all you need to do to create
viral influencer posts in all these content

127
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:56,879
formats. Just find them online and then repurpose
them from LinkedIn. For creating posts like

128
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:02,023
these, these are called viral tweet posts. I
will cover this in the next video.
