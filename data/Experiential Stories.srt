1
00:00:00,826 --> 00:00:04,735
So now we are going to take a look at experiential
stories. So this is the experiential story.

2
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:12,642
template in ClickUp, and the process begins with the 
outline section...subtask. So the content manager

3
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:17,764
first creates a copy of the template task, changes
the parent task status to outlines. Then they

4
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,965
need to add the post topic in the task title.
So that's over here. The post topic needs to

5
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:27,367
be filled. This needs to be edited. And then
an outline of that topic in the description.

6
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:32,649
So this is done usually on the content ideation
calls. Whatever content ideas that can be

7
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:40,248
the executive shares or the feedback that
they give on the ideas that you provide to

8
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:44,750
them. These ideas can be fetched on your own
or from the content ideation sheet. You need

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,513
to add them in here and detail it on the content
ideation call, and this needs to include like

10
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:55,075
what the experience is, what changes it brought,
what lesson was learned, what message or lessons

11
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:59,237
to be conveyed At the end of post everything
needs to be included in here. Make sure

12
00:00:59,615 --> 00:00:04,137
the outline is very well, um, detailed, uh, so 
that the copywriter has enough work

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,985
enough stuff to work on. And then next, he assigns
all the subtasks for all the team members.

13
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:14,749
So the subtasks will include the drafts for
the copywriter. So that is where they create

14
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:20,475
the draft of the post, the revision or the approval
process for the content managers. This

15
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:26,080
needs to be assigned to themselves like this,
and the executive approvals, The executive needs

16
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,499
this needs to be assigned to the executive.
This needs to be assigned to the executive

17
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:35,382
assistants on the team who will be handling
that the publishing process on LinkedIn, so

18
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:41,285
assign the subtasks to the relevant team members.
So all of these tasks are for that, and then

19
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:48,042
After he assigns it to all of them, he needs
to update the status of the content manager

20
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:55,687
needs to update the status of these subtasks
as assigned. So there will only be two subtask

21
00:01:55,707 --> 00:02:00,870
statuses. One will be assigned, and the other
one will be completed. So just mark it as assigned

22
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:08,456
and you're good to go. So after you mark it
as assigned, the last thing is change the 

23
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:08,756
parent task to Drafts status. So,

24
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:19,125
need to click on this and change the parent
task status to draft status. That's it. So

25
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:23,827
that the entire team is aware on where that
content piece is in the content management

26
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:28,529
process. And then after all these steps are
done, they can mark their subtask of outlines.

27
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:36,713
So this subtask of outlines as completed because
they've already added the outlines and finished

28
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:41,654
that entire process. They can go ahead and mark it as 
completed. Now the next step is the process for this subtask

29
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:48,102
process for this subtask has been covered already
in these checklists. Just go to here and follow

30
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:52,708
these one by one. So the first one is adding
the post copy. So review the outline that the

31
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:58,454
copyrighter added for you carefully, create
the post copy and add them in here. And the

32
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:02,418
post copy should have the hashtags. So which
is the next step. you need to add three to

33
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:07,200
four relevant hashtags with good followings.
We already covered how to do this in the previous

34
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,762
videos. That's usually good to go. And then
re-read the hook of the post copy. The hook

35
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:17,105
is very important for experiential stories and
all the LinkedIn posts. So re-read the hook

36
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:21,107
of the post copy and make sure it's catchy enough.
Then you add in the required first comments.

37
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:25,889
So first comments are only added if you need
to add external links or you need to add link

38
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:31,451
to another external source or you want them
to take an action specifically after they read

39
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:37,055
the post. So, If you're adding any first comment,
you need to mention it to the post copy that

40
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:42,558
check the first comment for so and so. So you
need to mention that in the post copy at the

41
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:47,420
end, and then you need to add a first comment
on how it's supposed to like any with any links

42
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,982
and so on. Do not include any direct external
links in the post copy, and then finally, they

43
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:57,805
need to add the image or photo of the experiential
story. So typically, experiential stories need

44
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:02,747
an image or photo, so that needs to be added in this 
step. And then finally, do a grammatical check

45
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:07,949
of all the post copy elements and then they just need 
to do two things. So the first thing is they mark

46
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:14,192
the subtask as complete, the subtask is complete,
they can click on here and mark it as complete,

47
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:19,054
click on completed and it's done. And then the
next thing is to move this to the next stage

48
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:23,535
in the content management process, which is
CM approval or revisions, so that the content

49
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:29,238
manager get go ahead and approve it or suggest
revisions. So that's it for the draft CW step.

50
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:36,944
The next step is the content manager approval or revisions 
step. So in here, what they need to do is they need to come in

51
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:45,808
here and Take a look at these checklists in this section. 
So they need to approve the content manager needs to 

52
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:51,991
review the post copy and the and the image or the photo with 
the experiential story. If there are revisions needed, they 

53
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,353
need to drop a comment in this section. Tagging, 
so you can tag like different team members like

54
00:04:56,373 --> 00:05:02,376
this. So you can tag the person, the CW, the
copywriter with the feedback and then move

55
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:07,698
the main parent task back to the draft section
so the entire team is aware that this is still

56
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:13,400
in drafts. And then set the status of the draft
CW subtasks, so that's this subtask, draft

57
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:23,603
CW subtask, move it back to a site. Okay, that's
it, and if any changes are required, now these

58
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:29,544
copyright will follow the entire checklist again
because it's back to drafts. Now if it is good

59
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:36,663
to go, they can move the parent task to. need
EX Approval. So it's been mentioned like which

60
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:42,065
task, which stage to move it to is already marked
in here. So you just need to follow the checklist

61
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:48,148
as it is. So they need to move it to need EX
Approval, and they need to mark their own sub

62
00:05:48,188 --> 00:05:54,111
task for CM Approval as completed because
they finished the review process. All right.

63
00:05:54,831 --> 00:06:00,414
Now the next step after that is for posting it on the
user profile. So this is for this subtask posting 

64
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:07,956
it in the user profile and the company page, since we 
assign to the executive assistants on the team and what 

65
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:15,278
they will do is they will first create the comments
using chat GPT and they will add the generated

66
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:21,700
comments as a comment in here for later reference.
They will check if the post elements like post

67
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,741
copy, image, photo, hashtags, etc., are all in
place in the description, so then you do a manual

68
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:34,266
check of that, and if it's not in like say good
to go, they need to contact the content manager

69
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:41,751
and get that sorted but if it's good to go they
can go ahead and post it on LinkedIn on the

70
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:47,115
executive's profile. They need to copy a link
to the LinkedIn post URL and add it in the

71
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:52,799
description section, so that's in here in the
description section, and then finally after

72
00:06:52,839 --> 00:07:01,577
they've done with both of them they need to
move the Academy, 18th strategy call, starts

73
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:02,442
at 10 minutes.

74
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:10,569
We need to move. Draw your gallery. Eighteen,
seven...

75
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:26,776
So they add the post URL in the respective section
in the description and then promote the post

76
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:31,258
in Link Boost or Lemp or the manual boards and
periodically check in over the next one hour

77
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:35,199
to respond to all the comments from the post.
So you need to reply to the comments and then

78
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:43,423
mark the ready to be posted subtasks. So this
subtask as completed, and you move the main

79
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:50,334
card to the ready to be posted user stage in
here, so that everyone is on the same page

80
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:59,166
on what the status is of the specific part of
the piece. And then finally, you mark the subtasks complete.

81
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:04,854
The subtasks complete. That's it for this step.
And the next step is that of

82
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:12,306
the company page. Now, we follow the exact same
process for the company page as well, and you

83
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:17,090
update the sub-tasks and the statuses. But for
the company page, you need to create new comments,

84
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,517
again in ChatGPT, and add them as a comment
in here, because you cannot use the same comments

85
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:27,280
for promoting in different places. And after
you publish on the company page, in this case,

86
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:35,272
you need to copy the link to the post URL in
the company page and add it to the description

87
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:39,895
as well in the LinkedIn post URL section, so
just post the links over there.
