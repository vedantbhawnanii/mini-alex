1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,070
So in this video, I'm going to walk
you through a step by step process to

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,570
identify gaps in your content strategy
using the gap identification sheet.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,069
We will compare what we're doing right
now with our content strategy with what

4
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:17,140
our competitors are doing and then use
what we learned to identify the gaps and

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,460
add good examples of content we need to
replicate or continue creating so that

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,230
when we design our content strategy,
we know exactly what we need to do.

7
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:27,105
This step will take about 1.

8
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,735
5 hours to complete fully,
including watching the training.

9
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:33,115
Now, without further
ado, let's jump into it.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:38,885
So this is the gap identification sheet
that we use to understand and analyze

11
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:42,545
the gap between what our competitors
are doing, what the industry is doing

12
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:44,424
in general, and what we are doing.

13
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:48,464
And both what the competitors
have been doing and what we are

14
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,035
doing with our existing content
have already been documented in

15
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,324
the competitor analysis sheet.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,600
and in the existing
content analysis sheet.

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,000
So we've done it for all our
competitors and we've done it for

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,540
all the existing content analysis.

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,850
Now, the gap identification will take
a lot of time, if you don't do it along

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,900
with the competitor analysis and the
existing content analysis, which is why

21
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:12,750
in the overview I clearly mentioned that
we have to do all three of these, which

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,710
is ideally all four of these, which is
the competitor analysis, the existing

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,920
content analysis, the gap identification,
as well as the content ideation.

24
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:23,975
Within a span of one day or a maximum
of two days, because the person who's

25
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:28,265
handling all three of these sheets should
be should remember what they've analyzed

26
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:31,114
so far so that they have a good idea so
that they can do this quickly, otherwise,

27
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:35,604
you will have to refer to each of the to
the data that you've already documented

28
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:38,805
in both these sheets and go through them
one by one and analyze them but if you do

29
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:42,045
it together, you can just recall it from
the top of your mind on, on what you saw.

30
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:42,095
Okay.

31
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,605
Competitors doing and you're doing all
right now, what we're going to do is

32
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:51,975
we are going to analyze each of the two
food, more food content and identify gaps.

33
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:55,074
So basically what we're doing over here
is we're going to think about, okay

34
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:58,914
is there a gap in the creation of blog
posts, which is a top of the funnel

35
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:01,275
content format short form blog posts.

36
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:04,755
So if competitors are
doing it, are we doing it?

37
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:08,494
So I can tell you that we are doing
it, but these are not very helpful

38
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:09,745
and we don't want to do this.

39
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,990
So we are able to identify gap or not.

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,440
We add hyperlinks with titles
to the type of content formats

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,490
that we need to replicate.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,220
And we mention, okay, should
this be one-off, should it

43
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,480
be created consistently?

44
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,260
And we give a name to this content format
for the latest stage of the process.

45
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,860
Alright, so this is what we are going
to do one by one for the entire thing.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,330
So what I'm gonna do first is I'm
gonna start off by recalling gaps in

47
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,329
each of these things in the process.

48
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,954
So I know for a fact from the
competitor analysis that I already

49
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,964
did for all the competitors
that I documented in the sheet.

50
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:47,265
And I also know which content formats are
being done because I just completed this.

51
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:50,324
So I'm going to quickly
see if there is a gap.

52
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:51,794
So how do we identify a gap?

53
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:55,174
A gap exists when we want to
continue to create something.

54
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:59,344
But we, we are not creating something,
but competitors in the space are doing it.

55
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,799
If you don't want to continue creating
that content format, it's fine.

56
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,649
You can mention that there is not a
gap and you don't need to add anything

57
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:10,129
in there, but if there is a gap, you
need to document all these columns

58
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:14,229
properly so that you can start creating
content in those formats actively.

59
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:15,909
Now, how do we go about this?

60
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:19,239
So regarding blog posts, we are
already creating a bunch of blog

61
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,969
posts, but we don't want to use we
don't want to proceed with this,

62
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,479
creating this content format because.

63
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:28,314
It's not very helpful to the audience and
it's the same way with the competitors.

64
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,934
The competitors are creating
short form blog posts as well.

65
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,884
I wouldn't say they're very helpful
to the, to the, to the users.

66
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:36,764
So these are the links to the
different short form content

67
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:39,084
pieces that they are using.

68
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:39,824
Sorry.

69
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:42,694
So yeah, but I wouldn't say
they're good content pieces.

70
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,674
So which is why I am going to recommend.

71
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:45,774
So these are the content pieces.

72
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:46,614
We can take a quick look.

73
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:50,269
Thank and form your opinions around it
again, once more, it's completely fine.

74
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,299
But I do not believe that these
are, this is a content format that

75
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,359
we should be going ahead with.

76
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:56,379
So I'm just going to mark it as no.

77
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:56,719
That's it.

78
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:57,089
Very simple.

79
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:01,699
Regarding LinkedIn posts of course, there
is a bunch of them that we need to do.

80
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,399
So if we take a look at the existing
content analysis on, on this post, this

81
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:08,579
helps me, keeps my audience engaged
with niche content updates and trends.

82
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,319
Now there are several content
formats in this section.

83
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,294
That we can use.

84
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:14,974
You can name them at this stage or
you can choose not to name them.

85
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:19,274
Most of the average stuff that we're doing
already are already there in the process.

86
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,934
You will understand that later on,
but for the time being what we can

87
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,664
do is we need to add hyperlinks
with titles to content formats.

88
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:28,554
You need to replicate that's
yours or your competitors.

89
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:31,504
So if you're doing something that you
really like and that's producing results.

90
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:33,854
Or that is generating a
good amount of engagement.

91
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,644
Or you like creating the content.

92
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:37,704
And you think it's valuable,
you're confident it's valuable.

93
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:39,704
You can include links to that in here.

94
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:43,554
So in our case, we are already doing a
bunch of stuff that, that we really like.

95
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,904
So, for example, top 10
construction projects.

96
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,504
So this is something that I like doing.

97
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:49,254
This is a carousel.

98
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:54,594
And this is usually it's, it's supposed
to be created consistently, right?

99
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:56,079
So this is a recurring.

100
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,929
So this is a recurring content
format, and this is a good

101
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:02,669
example of that content format.

102
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,749
And I can continue to do this process
for all of the ones in LinkedIn posts.

103
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:10,229
So for example, summary of
KPMG report, yes summary of

104
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,829
interesting reports in the space.

105
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:13,759
That is something we can include.

106
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,629
This should also be occurring, and
this was created as a carousel.

107
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,939
You could mention a content
format name over here.

108
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:24,774
But I would say this one is
better suited as a text course.

109
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:27,944
Please mention you don't have to
like, say it could be descriptive.

110
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:36,594
So you could enter some stuff like this
is a carousel on top 10 lists or listicle.

111
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:37,664
All right.

112
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:38,734
You could name it like that.

113
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,674
It's not necessary because we're not going
to be choosing this in the exact fashion

114
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:46,084
while we set up our content strategy,
but it's important to like, say, give

115
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:49,374
some description so that we understand
or get some context as to what it is.

116
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:49,994
All right.

117
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,809
Now let's keep proceeding with this.

118
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:55,019
So we have some content formats in here.

119
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,239
Let's look at the competitors.

120
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:58,659
Canadian economy and construction.

121
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,379
These are all good.

122
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:03,999
This is also a slide post, so this
is interesting story slide post.

123
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,019
That is how we would name it.

124
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,209
I really like that content format,
I think adds a lot of value.

125
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:10,229
It is also generating good
amount of engagement on the

126
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:11,309
profile and the key profile.

127
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:14,729
So this is also recurring and
this is a carousel or slide post

128
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:23,789
interesting  construction story.

129
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:24,559
Right.

130
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:29,999
And now see, it's not just enough
to include examples from our content

131
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:30,999
that we're already publishing.

132
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,769
We should also be taking
a look at the competitors.

133
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,219
If we could quickly take a look at
this for the not, do not spend a lot of

134
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,939
time on this to explain this process.

135
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,679
I'm just going to be taking the time
for now, but you should be looking at

136
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,869
all the competitors that have been nice.

137
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,579
We've analyzed five competitors already.

138
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,759
So I'm going to take a look at this and
I'm going to see, okay, what are some.

139
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:50,679
Content from as they're using on LinkedIn.

140
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,369
What are some good LinkedIn
posts that they're using.

141
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,879
So these are the TOFU content and these
are the LinkedIn posts that they're doing.

142
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,219
They're sharing blog posts their
employee experience stories.

143
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,429
So that is something that
we can, we could use.

144
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:02,999
So I'm going to copy that.

145
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,029
And that is something that I would
include in the gap identification

146
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,729
sheet as an employee experience story.

147
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,289
So in a moment stories you
can just copy and paste it.

148
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:15,509
All right.

149
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:15,569
Thank you.

150
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:24,049
This is also a recurring and this is
can be image posts with text, right?

151
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:24,479
Simple.

152
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,779
You don't need to give like a
huge very descriptive title.

153
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,449
You can just mention or a very
branded title to the content format.

154
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,449
You can just mention
what it is at this stage.

155
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,829
And now we can move on to videos, right?

156
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,799
So in this manner, we're going to
go through the entire sheet and

157
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:38,739
we're going to take a look at.

158
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:39,564
Okay.

159
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:40,914
Is there a gap now?

160
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:42,694
How do we identify there is a gap?

161
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:45,634
We take a look at the existing content
analysis sheet and we see we are

162
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:47,134
already creating that content format.

163
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:51,154
And if there is a gap in that
process we name it as such.

164
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:53,924
If there is no gap in that
process, we leave it completely.

165
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:56,744
But if there is a gap in that
process, we make sure that we add

166
00:07:56,754 --> 00:07:58,134
hyperlinks to content formats.

167
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:01,644
We name if it is one off
or created consistently.

168
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:05,714
And we also include a description about
that content format, what format format.

169
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:05,854
Thank you.

170
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:06,809
Should it be in.

171
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,869
All right, now we're going
to continue with this process

172
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,109
until we document all of this.

173
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,849
So I'm going to quickly go through
and fill all of these out for you.

174
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,329
So that you don't spend too
much time watching the video

175
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,309
rather than doing the work.

176
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:22,579
So I just filled out the video column.

177
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,329
So what I found is that there is a gap.

178
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,879
So we like the event videos.

179
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:30,539
It is supposed to be done recurring
because it'll happen multiple times.

180
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:33,874
And I named them as event or conference
templates for conference format.

181
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:36,494
And we also noticed that there
are explainer videos, video

182
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:37,594
sales letters, and building.

183
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,794
There is a, they have a podcast
series as well, Builder Trends

184
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:41,254
specifically, that is performing well.

185
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:44,924
So we added them explainer videos
and video sales that just need to

186
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,214
be created once or twice at the max.

187
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:51,194
But so I added them as one time
and the podcast series is incurring

188
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:52,674
and I just named them accordingly.

189
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,424
That is it with this section.

190
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:56,864
And next we go to in depth blog posts.

191
00:08:57,674 --> 00:09:00,274
So I just looked at in depth blog
posts and it looks like there are

192
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,004
a bunch of blog posts that are
quite in depth that are valuable.

193
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:07,429
And from our existing content analysis,
we already know that we are not

194
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:10,449
creating a lot of more full content
or middle of the funnel content.

195
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,699
So I'm going to find examples
from competitors that we can use.

196
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,559
And yes, there is a content gap over here.

197
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,299
These are recurring content
pieces and I've just named them as

198
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,139
actionable tutorials because both
of them are actionable tutorials.

199
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,149
That help them solve pain points
like tracking construction

200
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,449
equipments and managing and
improving construction plan flow.

201
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:27,339
Both are pain points.

202
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,979
And these blog posts help
them explain that, right?

203
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,409
You can take a look at
the blog posts as well.

204
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:36,269
And we move on to strategy and how to
focus LinkedIn posts and add examples.

205
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,989
So we are not doing this at the moment.

206
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:40,529
This is something that we should be doing.

207
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,909
And we've already mentioned that
we've needed, need to create continue

208
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:44,999
creating this content format.

209
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:50,744
So I'm going to mark this as yes, there
aren't many good examples of strategy

210
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:52,314
and how to focus LinkedIn posts.

211
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:58,284
It is not necessary that you shouldn't do
something just because your competitors or

212
00:09:58,284 --> 00:10:00,024
you yourself are not doing it right now.

213
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:05,014
Most businesses are unaware of how much
LinkedIn can help them generate leads.

214
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,624
So if it is LinkedIn specific content.

215
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:11,564
Or even websites must be content just
because your competitors are not doing it

216
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:12,974
does not mean that you shouldn't do it.

217
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:15,644
Even if you're not able to find
good examples you should, you

218
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:16,894
can mention it as occurring.

219
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:21,195
So I wasn't able to find any good
examples of how to focus LinkedIn posts.

220
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,364
Most of them is like company updates.

221
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,564
Product feature updates and stuff
like that that these companies, all

222
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:27,724
the companies publish on LinkedIn.

223
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:31,664
So I was unable to find any good examples,
even in the competitor analysis, but.

224
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:35,274
This is a content format that
I'm confident we should be doing.

225
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:38,944
So, which is why I'm going to mark
it as recurring and I'm going to mark

226
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:41,464
it as actionable tutorial as well.

227
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:42,724
It's the same content format.

228
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:45,944
In fact this content format,
which is end up blog post can be

229
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,174
repurposed into a LinkedIn post.

230
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:49,104
I just feel it's the same topic.

231
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:53,964
It's the same format that we need for this
because it's a how to focus LinkedIn post

232
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,854
and this is how to focus blog post, right?

233
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:58,509
So, I'm going to mark it the same way.

234
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:02,759
Now, videos strategy, education, focus,
LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, reels

235
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,409
related to the service or product.

236
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:05,809
Let's take a look at that next.

237
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,809
Now regarding videos, I've
identified that there is a gap

238
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,339
and most of them are webisodes.

239
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:17,879
So I identified two specific
webisodes that are good examples of

240
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,319
prime examples of, of what we want.

241
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:24,024
They implemented the section, so I'm
just going to include that in here.

242
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:28,554
And I'm going to mark them as recurring
because, well, they're recurring.

243
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:33,674
And these are both webisodes
or webinars that they organize.

244
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:35,924
I'm going to include that in here again.

245
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:39,704
Webinars can fall, it's, it's not
necessary that one specific content

246
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:44,854
format, say like webinars or white papers
and so on falls into one specific format.

247
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:47,294
It can, it can fall into
both TOFU and MOFO content.

248
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,069
So if they're selling something at the
end of the webinar, it can, it can be

249
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:55,219
both MOFU content and TOFU content,
but at the same time, many webinars

250
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:59,369
focus on adding a lot of value in the
webinar, teaching people something

251
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:00,959
and then selling something at the end.

252
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:03,199
So both of these webinars
are in that format.

253
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:07,649
We evaluated these in the competitive
analysis process in that video.

254
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,629
So I think that good examples of
this, so I'm going to mark it as this.

255
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:12,854
And then we move on to white papers.

256
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:15,434
Again, this is not something
that we do actively right now.

257
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:16,154
There is a gap.

258
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:18,554
We want to create more
white papers that are good.

259
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:21,354
And if I take a quick look at the
competitor analysis sheet, I can

260
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:25,044
already see that this client is not
creating white papers, but it is

261
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,384
something that we need to do actively.

262
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:31,134
So I've identified some other white
papers from other competitors, and

263
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,834
I'm going to add them in this one now.

264
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:36,464
So I've identified
white papers and eBooks.

265
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,259
We are not doing both of these,
but I identified good examples

266
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,599
from our competitor analysis
sheet and I included them in here.

267
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:45,959
All of them are supposed to be recurring.

268
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,059
So let me just put that out as well.

269
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:52,529
All of these are supposed to be recurring
and I've also named some added a

270
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:55,179
descriptive name to this content format.

271
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:58,539
So this one is a white paper on a
specific pain point using a data study.

272
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:00,049
Put topic and type.

273
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:00,559
Okay.

274
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:03,174
And this one is a white paper
on a specific pain point.

275
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:04,964
This is an industrial report.

276
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:05,864
This is an industrial report.

277
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:08,534
And this is a process template
that's helpful to the audience.

278
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:10,244
It's a construction daily huddle template.

279
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:15,234
And this is a guide or an actionable
tutorial that teaches them about mastering

280
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:17,305
takeoff for estimations in construction.

281
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:18,879
So that is it with these.

282
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,879
And these are, these are,
these are gaps as well.

283
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,509
Now, webinars and conferences,
of course, we have gaps.

284
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:26,089
We have a lot of good examples
of podcasts, webinars, and

285
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,939
newsletters, which we can include.

286
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:32,379
Again, it's not necessary that you
mark them as you have a gap if you're

287
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,659
only interested in creating it.

288
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,829
What we want this sheet to be is to
understand if there is an actual gap,

289
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,759
if competitors are doing it or not
if we are doing it or not, we need

290
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,159
to document it in here so that in
the future we can understand, okay,

291
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,734
this there is a gap at this process.

292
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:49,144
So which content formats do we prioritize?

293
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:50,234
What do we start with right now?

294
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:52,404
So it's not important that you mark this.

295
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:55,604
Yes, only if you want to create
that content format, you can

296
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:56,474
also do it in the future.

297
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:56,944
All right.

298
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:00,434
So let me add links to webinars
and conferences as well.

299
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:06,034
So I've included podcasts and
newsletters and webinars as well in here.

300
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:09,494
So I found some good examples
of the copy data analysis sheet.

301
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:10,654
These are all occurring.

302
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:10,724
Thank you.

303
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:12,934
And this one is a pain
point focus webinar.

304
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:14,724
This one is also a pain
point focus webinar.

305
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:17,114
This is a conference for the podcast.

306
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:19,954
I found only one podcast,
interesting podcast series.

307
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:24,014
This is run by Builder Trend and
they are an interview podcast series.

308
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:26,644
And for newsletters, I
found Construction Time.

309
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:30,254
It's a, it's a good podcast, sorry,
newsletter series that they're running.

310
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:33,484
Interestingly a lot of the comp
leaders we analyzed are not running

311
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:35,294
active newsletters that they promote.

312
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:37,394
So this one is also recurring.

313
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:38,994
It's a good example that we can analyze.

314
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,234
And we, I just named it as newsletter.

315
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:44,654
And now we move on to BOFU
content which is the last part

316
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,264
of the gap identification sheet.

317
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,554
And let's go through case
studies, testimonials demos,

318
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,294
et cetera, and fill this out.

319
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:55,094
Now regarding case studies, we do
have a gap over here, but I think

320
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:58,434
what we can include over here
are both our case studies as well

321
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:00,444
as some links to case studies.

322
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:04,344
That our competitors are publishing
so that we get a good understanding or

323
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:08,224
good inspiration on like what format
we can use for those case studies.

324
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:09,584
So let me go ahead and fill this out.

325
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,114
So I've looked through the existing
content analysis sheet and the competitor

326
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,254
analysis sheet and I've filled out
the go for content section as well.

327
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:19,664
So we started off with case studies.

328
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:22,334
I found very good case studies
that we should use as examples.

329
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,189
They're all recurring because we
do it for each client, and they

330
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,329
just named them as case studies.

331
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:27,799
We found testimony videos.

332
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:30,999
I've only included two in them because
I think these are really good format

333
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,479
and I don't want to add more ideas.

334
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:36,459
But if you find really good examples
that you're impressed by, always

335
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:39,369
try to fill out at least four or
you can add more rows as well.

336
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:43,359
But try to include as many examples, as
many good examples as possible for these.

337
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:43,779
All right?

338
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,869
And we need to do this ideally
for each client that we have.

339
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:48,779
So it's a recurring
one, it's a testimonial.

340
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,504
Demos and free consultations.

341
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:52,904
We don't really have a gap for
this because we already have a

342
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,334
demo and we only need one demo.

343
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,084
We don't need multiple types of demos.

344
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,114
You could include them for your use case.

345
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:01,604
If you feel that you're offering a
different you're focusing on different

346
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:05,344
verticals and you have multiple
products or features within your product

347
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:08,164
that you want to market and you want
different kinds of demos make sense.

348
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:09,304
In that case, you can do it.

349
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:12,324
And if you're in the service industry
and you want to offer different

350
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:16,894
types of consultations for your sales
process, you can include different

351
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,954
kinds of consultations as well in
here, but we don't have a requirement

352
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:22,054
for this for trace cost or case study.

353
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:24,184
So we're not going to use it now.

354
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:25,424
Competitive comparisons.

355
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:28,954
Interestingly, most of the competitors
we analyze do not have competitive

356
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:33,204
comparisons, which is why we didn't
explain that this content format in detail

357
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:35,564
during the competition analysis process.

358
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:35,749
Thanks.

359
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,739
But let me quickly show you
what this content format is.

360
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,659
Because this is very important.

361
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:44,009
Now, what a competitive comparison
does ideally is compare your product

362
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:48,044
with another product and explain
why your product is better because

363
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:49,474
you have better features and so on.

364
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:54,354
Even if they have like Vimo features
what we need to do is explain our

365
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:58,934
core selling proposition for USB in
this content format so that people

366
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,444
are more inclined to buy our product
or like our core target audience is

367
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:03,934
more inclined to buy our product.

368
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:07,304
And this is important because people
do search for when they're evaluating

369
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:10,524
multiple softwares, people do
search for competitive comparison.

370
00:17:10,524 --> 00:17:12,984
So if I was evaluating both
Procore and Buildertrend.

371
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:16,729
I would do a Google search of
core versus build a trend to

372
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,009
understand which is better.

373
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,939
It's like doing something like
Gmail versus Outlook or Namecheap

374
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:27,119
versus Codaddy, which are domain
registrars to understand which

375
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,279
solution is better for my business.

376
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,339
So this is what a
competitive comparison is.

377
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:34,409
So we, in detail, we, we analyze this.

378
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:39,489
It could be shorter because I was
not able to find good examples

379
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:40,799
from the competitors we analyzed.

380
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:43,919
I did a Google search for this
for Build a Trend versus Procore.

381
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,779
I found some good examples
on other websites comparing

382
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,519
both the products and so on.

383
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,259
And I included them in here.

384
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:55,529
Now this is a one time activity because
we only need to do this for like our

385
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,639
main competitors, which are the max four
or five in TraceCostcase and I've just

386
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,279
named them as competitive comparisons.

387
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:04,189
Then we have customer experience stories.

388
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,409
We have a bunch of them that
are really good examples of

389
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:07,599
customer experience stories.

390
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:11,104
I've included them in here
and okay, this is a duplicate.

391
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:14,294
I'm just going to leave that
and ideally include all the

392
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,494
good examples that you find.

393
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,244
If you're not impressed with an example,
you don't need to include them here,

394
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:21,774
but if you think that a good example
and good reference points you can

395
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:23,594
include them in here and label them.

396
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:26,604
And finally, we have product
walkthroughs or explainer videos.

397
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:29,284
Which we've included in
here and label them as well.

398
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:33,434
And that brings us to the identification
brings us to the end of the gap

399
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:34,914
identification sheet process.

400
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:40,874
And we've documented all the gaps that
we have and we've included good examples

401
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:44,584
and we've even given names to the
content formats that we found to be good.

402
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:45,614
All right.

403
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:47,474
So that's it for this video.

404
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:48,974
See you in the next one.
