1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:07,732
So this is the video on how to create content
in different content formats. And in this video,

2
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:14,955
I'll explain first the general rules that you
have to follow for all content formats that

3
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:21,018
you create content on. We'll first talk about
the elements that we could link and copy. So

4
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:25,100
I'll go through each of the elements that you
should be focusing on. And these apply to all

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,606
content formats that we teach you in the IG
program. But the first element that we need

6
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:36,828
to talk about are optimizing the first three
lines. Now, when you take a look at a post

7
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:46,150
on LinkedIn, so take a look at this post or
this post or, well, any of the posts on LinkedIn,

8
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:52,792
LinkedIn only shows us the first two to three
lines of the post at the start. Only if you

9
00:00:52,812 --> 00:01:02,196
click on the see more link, can we see more
of the content. Now, Think of the part before

10
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:06,559
the C-molec as the headline of an article that
convinces users to click through to read it.

11
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:12,264
So you will have to spend a lot of time to work
on optimizing these three lines because without

12
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:17,448
optimizing those three lines nobody is going
to read the post. So and this applies for both

13
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:24,254
content formats with media formats in them.
So if it's a carousel or an image post or a

14
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:30,794
video post or a normal text post it applies
to all of them. Here is an example of a great

15
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:34,376
informative first three lines. So this is of
course by Sam Jacobs, he's a good creator.

16
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:38,378
Should you exercise your equity when you leave
your startup? I get that question hundreds

17
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:43,080
of times here. Here's my biggest piece of advice.
So anybody who reads these first three lines,

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,103
they will be too enticed to click on the C-Molling
because they just want to understand what the

19
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:54,826
biggest piece of advice is, which is why you
see good engagement on this content.

20
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:04,171
hooks which is the name that we give to these
first three lines because we are hooking the

21
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:11,996
user and getting them to read more of the post.
Let's take a look at some other types of optimizations

22
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:17,660
some specific types of optimizations that you
can use for these first three lines of hooks.

23
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:23,804
So the first type of optimization is that of
a paragraph. So here's a paragraph. Columbia's

24
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:24,064
biggest

25
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:34,031
It's Latin America's third largest and fastest
growing tech talent hub with 100k skilled highly

26
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,754
skilled engineers. So that's a very a bit of
controversial but at the same time it's a very

27
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:46,439
interesting thing because not most people have
learned this about Columbia yet. So it's a

28
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:54,004
new statistic and take a look at this. Just
look at the infamous medley Pablo Escobar and

29
00:02:55,285 --> 00:03:00,168
it's about Pablo Escobar which is already an
interesting topic. So more people will be interested

30
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:08,174
in checking VC Bowling and hence the engagement
on post. Now this is a hack sort of. With which

31
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:14,097
you can use a paragraph style beginning to start
your LinkedIn copy Now if we use a lot of white

32
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:19,619
space like this, we cannot add a lot of content
So if you add like one more line in here, it

33
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:24,842
won't be shown Before the single link, but if
you use a paragraph you can add include more

34
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:32,605
content in the first few lines without having
to add spaces so this gives you around like

35
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:39,989
30 to 50 characters to work with and this is
we first talk about a controversial statement.

36
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:44,072
So take a look at what we did here. Columbia's
biggest export post pandemic won't be cocaine,

37
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:48,995
but global tech talent, right? That's a controversial
statement. Then we added data to bracket or

38
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:54,619
the proof. So this is the data to bracket. It's
Latin America's third largest and fastest-growing

39
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,322
tech talent hub with 100K highly skilled engineers.
And then finally a hint that there's proof

40
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:06,007
inside of the user clicks on C, okay? So just
look at the infimius. So this is kind of leading

41
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:12,407
to the proof inside the blaster. Now, I am going
to give you more examples of this exact format

42
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:18,930
over here. Old Farts 61%, Dynos of 56%, and
old people don't understand, technology 60%,

43
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:26,654
congrats. You just stumbled into the CDRWF tech,
age discrimination. But is there really age-saving

44
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:30,355
tech? So it follows the exact same structure
that we mentioned over here. We had our control

45
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:36,418
of the statement, we add some data in it to
back it, and a hint that there is proof inside

46
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:45,344
in here. So this is how you use paragraph style
optimization to lead users to click on this

47
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:51,768
email link. We will talk about hooks in detail
later on, but this is the first type of optimization

48
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:56,591
that you can use using paragraphs. Now the second
type of optimization is using text and white

49
00:04:56,631 --> 00:05:05,938
space. Now we saw this example already, but
this is using one line spacing in between like

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,244
that you can need to click get people to click
on the single link. Now this works very well

51
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:19,527
on LinkedIn, this works on Twitter a lot you
may have seen this a lot on Twitter especially

52
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:27,972
in tweets that use tweet threads so people publish
the entire post as a thread in a tweet as opposed

53
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:33,636
to a single tweet and it's also working very
well on Medium right now. With this you have

54
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:38,279
about 20 to 25 characters to work with so if
you need more content if you need to add more

55
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,884
is a better format but if you don't need to
just need to add like a short hook then this

56
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:49,309
is a better format that you can use and let's
take a look at some examples here is another

57
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:55,535
example old school venture capital is dead founders
just don't want money anymore here's why right

58
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:59,699
it's a very simple hook where you start with
a quarter versus statement

59
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:08,989
and then lead people to get them to click on
the Zemo link. Here is more examples. So this

60
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,112
is example three where we see most startups
do not fail because of a bad idea. In fact,

61
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:18,034
ideas is the little element. So it is controversy.
Here is why they really fail. So we are leading

62
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:23,137
them to the proof inside and get them to click
on the Zemo link. Let me show you one more

63
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:30,064
example. there's a massive misconception about
crypto and it's just not true. Crypto not equal

64
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:35,127
to scams, here's proof versus fiat. Right, so
we're starting off with the controversial statements

65
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:43,859
and we're leading them to click on the Simulink.
Now Now the third type of optimization is specific

66
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:48,561
for posts with media, so any kind of media,
so it can be videos, it can be images, polls

67
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:53,543
and slide posts or carousels. So for text posts
we have three lines that we can optimize, like

68
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:58,185
the examples that we just saw, we have three
lines that we can use to lead people to the

69
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:03,488
CMO leg, but for media, any posts with media,
we only have two lines, the dictionary only

70
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:08,410
offers us two lines, this may change later on,
but at the moment we only have two lines.

71
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:17,355
that get people to click on the CBO link and
read the rest of the post copy. So in such

72
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:27,462
cases, we get to the controversy faster and
we need people to the proof that is covered

73
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:32,065
inside the post copy faster. So we start off
with a controversial statement in one single

74
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:37,169
line, so it needs to be shorter and then we
add one single line to get people to click

75
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:46,515
on the CBO example of a pole and this is another
example of a carousel so stop using keyword

76
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:50,918
difficulties goes in SU tools so that's a very
controversial statement because keyword difficulty

77
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:57,102
is typically used a lot in SU tools all SUs
use them and then he's talking about keyword

78
00:07:57,122 --> 00:08:02,926
difficulty only considers one variable backlinks
so I get that now I'm curious as a as an ex-SU

79
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:10,211
because now I want to understand what are the
variables are included or like why is a keyword

80
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:16,436
So we leading people into click on the Cmolink
very quickly. So one controversy statement

81
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:23,281
and then the leading in To the rest of the post
copy. So it's not way more faster than typical

82
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:31,268
Expose Now while these are good examples of
the structure that you should follow or the

83
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:38,504
hook optimization guidelines that you have to
keep in mind while creating the hook or the

84
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:44,228
first three lines of your post. It's quite difficult
to like keep coming up with new hooks for each

85
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:50,213
and every single post that you create which
is why we've created, we've included over a

86
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:56,918
hundred viral hook ideas that we've tested that
we figured out in the past and we use these

87
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:04,411
constantly for our own posts. So these are all
borrowed. online from other creators or the

88
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:09,933
well-known creators and Our own booths that
we've created in the past and we've organized

89
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:13,575
them in the playbook for you So all you need
to do every single time you you're looking

90
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:19,157
to create a good hook is come in here Scroll
through all the hooks that we've used over

91
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:24,760
here and just use them According to the outline
that is offered over here So what I'm gonna

92
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,982
do is I'm gonna go through some of these and
I'm gonna explain like how to use a hook So

93
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:33,765
that you can use these in your booths. Take
a look at this one Give me two minutes and

94
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:37,227
I'll teach you six rules to be charismatic.
So if you're writing a post about building

95
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:43,651
your charisma, this is a hook that you can use.
Now what I've included in brackets over here

96
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:48,554
is an outline that is built around this hook.
So we've reverse engineered the hook and created

97
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:55,479
an outline for you. So give me x minutes and
I'll teach you y rules, okay, to achieve whatever

98
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:56,320
desirable thing it is.

99
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:09,488
teaching construction project managers about
managing their team better. I would kind of

100
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:16,593
personalize this to say give me three minutes
and I'll teach you seven cardinal rules to

101
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:22,357
manage your team in the best fashion, manage
your construction workforce in the best fashion

102
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,420
or manage a project in the best fashion. So
whatever topic or like value addition you're

103
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,821
offering in the post which is the

104
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:37,647
to like 2 minutes and extra rolls or like 6
rolls or 7 rolls or whatever it is. So that

105
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:42,330
is how you use a hook. So this is an example
of the hook, the original hook and this is

106
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,874
the reverse engineered outline that you can
use on it. Here's another one, the 95 is getting

107
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:52,817
pummeled. So this is a bold opening statement,
so which is why we reverse engineer that if

108
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:57,060
you have an outline over here, the grade designation
is growing faster than ever. So we are adding

109
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:11,390
more fuel to the fire and love it. Why? loop.
So, to get lead people into the C MOLING. So,

110
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,213
here is another simple hook that you can use
for a lot of different types of content that

111
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:21,417
you create. Most advice about X is wrong, a
lot of personal plan advice will set you up

112
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:28,975
for failure. So, we say a lot of what they teach
is wrong. So, how about a specific topic? Here

113
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:32,479
are five things you should ignore if you are
thinking of getting started. So we say reveal

114
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:37,604
common means that Guru is right. So that is
another outline for a hook that you can use

115
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:46,314
to create a piece of content. Now here is another
one, how to make money on LinkedIn. So we promised

116
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:50,998
to teach something valuable and how to build
the algo. Then we add a second promise. In

117
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:54,680
a second, you'll read about how to take advantage
of LinkedIn, how to beat the algo, how you

118
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,203
can monetize. So we get teasing them and building
the anticipation You can feel free to edit

119
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:11,108
these, feel free to add your own hooks in the
future, in your own copy or your own documents

120
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:17,991
that you use for the copywriters so that over
time, you build a good hook database. But these

121
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:24,698
100 viral hooks should be a very good starting
point to help you craft really good hooks for

122
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:30,384
your posts for different types of content. So
this is not restricted to any one content format

123
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:38,647
you can use these for all types of content formats.
So after the hook optimization or the optimizing

124
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:44,150
the first three lines, the next element we come
to is the paragraph optimization. So by default

125
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,412
whenever a writer creates content, the idea
is to create paragraphs. So that is only the

126
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:54,034
case language works, you create paragraphs as
combinations of sentences. But when you are

127
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:57,916
creating social media content, you need to follow
a different approach. The truth is nobody reads

128
00:12:58,016 --> 00:13:02,978
long paragraphs anymore. Paragraphs should be
short and broken down into multiple short sentences

129
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:11,404
because what for attention. If you add like
clunky paragraphs or long paragraphs subconsciously

130
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:17,007
whenever a reader is seeing that paragraph they
immediately think there is a lot of work to

131
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:21,490
see that paragraph and they would not read it
irrespective of how good the post may be or

132
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,733
how valuable the content may be. So this is
something that you always have to keep in mind

133
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:32,698
when you are creating content. What I am about
to show you is a few examples of well structured

134
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:38,642
posts even if there are paragraphs so that they
have kept the paragraphs with sentences short

135
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:45,646
and with one line proper one line spacing so
that whenever a reader sees the post they just

136
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:52,371
read through the lines. If they do not like
say get blocked or they do not feel a subconscious

137
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:59,175
blocker to reading that post because when they
see like clunky paragraphs they do not feel

138
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:05,200
that simply because the structure dwell. So
this is the right way to optimize your paragraphs.

139
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,002
So take a look at this one what this reader
job what this creator Jonathan has done is

140
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:16,986
he's included an okay hook not a very good hook
a little bit but take a look at his how he

141
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:22,208
structured it so he's added a topic and he's
added two lines spaced by with a one line spacing.

142
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:30,773
Next topic two paragraphs but again spaced out
well. Again a topic and then again these are

143
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:36,356
basically sentences but again. with one line
spacing in them. So they've done it really

144
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:43,581
well as opposed to like say using something
like this. So this is a very bad example of

145
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:50,106
how you shouldn't be doing it. So adding like
say very sizable paragraphs with like multiple

146
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:55,990
lines over two sentences is a very bad idea.
Take a look at this one. Immediately like as

147
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:01,680
you see something like this as opposed to seeing
something like this. He won't make this decision

148
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,650
consciously, the reader won't make this decision
consciously. As soon as they see something

149
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:12,351
like this, their eye will just skip away. subconsciously
because they do not want to read, they do not

150
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:16,653
want to take a lot of put a lot of work into
reading something. Consumption should be made

151
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:22,015
as easy as possible so that they can read through
the post and understand what you are talking

152
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:28,798
about. So it is a very simple thing to do all
you need to do is create short sentences and

153
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:36,661
always add one line spacing in between those
lines. So formatting optimization is the next

154
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:41,768
step and it is just like paragraph optimization,
but what we are trying to do here is the way

155
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:51,204
the information is presented to the audience
in the most. So there is two things that we

156
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:59,337
need to focus on here. take two types of formatting
it was. So, one is what we call skimming. So,

157
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:06,340
skimming is when you create a post that is very
easily consumable, very easily readable. And

158
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:12,403
for that we use what we call meme style formatting.
So, meme style formatting is something that

159
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:20,126
has been popularized by a creator called Justin
Welch. So, what he does is he creates quickly

160
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:27,630
readable short posts. So, most of the posts
that you see on LinkedIn and he just adds quick

161
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,673
bullet points like a very quick pointer on how
it looks. It is not exactly like paragraphs,

162
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:37,275
it is not exactly one lines because he is structuring
them accordingly. So, if it is eight questions,

163
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:43,319
so the eight questions are written as one liners
and then there are a few other lines for the

164
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,679
intro or the hook and the

165
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:54,700
Here is another example of something by Jess
Cook. So Jess Cook is also a content marketer.

166
00:16:55,801 --> 00:17:03,852
So take a look at this. So she is talking about.
tackling the first research reporter. So, this

167
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:09,576
is one topic, so starting the first three steps
for the starting and that leads to the survey

168
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:14,120
questions which is the next two steps for the
survey questions which leads to the top line

169
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,883
stats, the next two questions for the top line
stats. So, you see how the formatting is done

170
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:27,012
for each of these. So, she is categorized them
into specific topics or stages in the process

171
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:32,954
that she is about to cover, that she wants to
cover and it is segregated or segmented accordingly

172
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:42,179
in the post. So, come up with skimmability is
all about coming up with easy to read formats

173
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:48,242
that people can quickly skim through. So, skimming
is reading very quickly. So, take a look at

174
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:49,042
the 60 second

175
00:17:52,624 --> 00:17:57,088
one type of content, four of them. Pick your
industrial level topic, four of them. So, people

176
00:17:57,128 --> 00:18:03,675
can read these quickly and this type of content
performs really well. We format it in this

177
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:08,781
manner, it performs really well for the simple
reason that people can consume it very quickly.

178
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:15,739
and read through it really quickly. Always remember
that copywriting is all about, the first line

179
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,323
should be about getting users to read the second
line, the second line should be about getting

180
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:25,249
readers to read the third line. So, every single
line in your post should be optimized for getting

181
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:32,736
people to be able to consume it quickly, you
need to reduce the friction of, of the mental

182
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:40,268
friction of people having to. read the post
and spend time of the post. So make it as easy

183
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:46,570
as possible for them. This is the goal of formatting.
Now what we took a look at over here is called

184
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:53,753
skimming optimization. There is another type
of formatting that we can use which is called

185
00:18:53,813 --> 00:19:00,556
concentrating. So concentrating is about getting
people to focus on a specific topic and we

186
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:06,878
keep like a few paragraphs or lines in between.
So This is very good for formats like listicle.

187
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:12,500
So for example, we already saw this example
where Jonathan wrote a four pointer about four

188
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,201
pointer post about major content books you need
for like a paid social strategy. So he talked

189
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:21,702
about thought leadership and some detail about
thought leadership, product marketing and some

190
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:26,363
detail about product marketing, social proof
and some detail about social proof. So he is

191
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:30,805
concentrating on each of these topics one by
one and detailing about it. So that is the

192
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:39,856
way he is formatted the content of the post.
Now you can use both of these elements in your

193
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:46,178
content but pay some attention to the skimming
formatting because it's a very important formatting

194
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:51,220
element that you need to keep in mind when you
structure the content of your posts and this

195
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,063
is across the board for all content formats
all types of content formats you create not

196
00:19:57,123 --> 00:20:01,165
specifically for like informative posts which
is what this content format is.

197
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:12,499
Yeah, all of these are informative posts, content
formats. Now we have lead videos later on in

198
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:18,623
the program that are dedicated to each content
format. that will teach you about how the content

199
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:23,226
management process looks like in the content
world for each of the content formats one by

200
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:28,929
one. I'll talk about how the content management
process works in ClickUp. I'll talk about how

201
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:32,932
the content ideation process works and how we
can go about creating the content formats easily.

202
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:39,797
And I'll talk about the differences in the content
creation for each of those content formats

203
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:48,641
as well. But the next topic we are moving on
to is hashtags. So hashtags are important because

204
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:53,764
they help you categorize your post, help the
algorithm categorize your post and present

205
00:20:53,784 --> 00:21:03,649
it to a more relevant audience. And the typical
usage of hashtags is very wrong you could say.

206
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,534
Even on LinkedIn because what most users do
is they add they find a lot of relevant hashtags

207
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:13,737
that you later to the post They don't do much
research about it And they assume that adding

208
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:20,303
more hashtags will get you more reach that is
completely wrong The way hashtags work on LinkedIn

209
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:26,528
is clearly outlined in the LinkedIn algorithm
report And what it states what it found is

210
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:35,228
that statistically Posts with hashtags more
than five hashtags tend to reduce the reach

211
00:21:35,268 --> 00:21:42,521
of the post. So the maximum number of hashtags
that you should be adding in your post should

212
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:48,436
be five so you shouldn't go beyond five now
how do we select these hashtags which is the

213
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:54,418
big question so selecting these hashtags is
done by manually researching so assume let's

214
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:59,561
take this post as an example so this is about
content buckets you need for successful paid

215
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:04,943
social strategy right so social media marketing
is obviously the first hashtag that I would

216
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:09,305
consider so what I would do is I would type
a hashtag at the start and then I would do

217
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:10,966
social media marketing now what I would

218
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:20,173
to see how many followers it has because The
best hashtags have the most number of followers

219
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,997
So ideally you should be selecting hashtags
that are topically relevant to your posts and

220
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:29,842
at the same time have a good following So if
I wanted to compare social media marketing

221
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:32,965
and social media I could easily see

222
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:42,876
that social media has way more followers than
social media marketing. So if I was to choose

223
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:47,763
between social media and social media marketing,
I would definitely go with social media. Now

224
00:22:47,843 --> 00:22:53,966
how do you find more hashtags? So product marketing
is one of the... Pointers mentioning here thought

225
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:59,269
leadership is a point I mentioned in here. So
all of these are Our stuff I could include

226
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:04,951
all of this is basically about Content marketing
in general or marketing in general. So all

227
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:12,275
of these are hashtags that I can search for
I would look for specific more niche Topics

228
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:17,017
so I've included social media in here. So now
what I could do is I would look for product

229
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:22,369
Marketing let's see if product marketing is
there and see like what the hashtag what the

230
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:28,775
follower count is So what eight thousand followers
not too bad, but I wouldn't see it's too big

231
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:35,141
either So let's try to find some better hashtags
So single image ads so they're talking about

232
00:23:35,222 --> 00:23:43,605
advertising right so advertising is a good broad
hashtag that I could use so advertising if

233
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:47,690
you take a look at it should have okay large
number of followers so this is a good hashtag

234
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:54,056
I can use and then we're talking about successful
paid social strategy so it's basically social

235
00:23:54,997 --> 00:24:01,350
media advertising, social advertising. So let's
take a look at social advertising. Okay, not

236
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:10,299
very impressive. So we'll keep doing this process
until I figure out some good hashtags. So image

237
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:17,226
ads, let's see, okay, image ads doesn't seem
to have much. So let's see, how about ads,

238
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:28,237
like just ads? That should be a hashtag. Okay,
not very big, but somewhat okay. Thought leadership,

239
00:24:28,318 --> 00:24:29,241
how about thought leadership?

240
00:24:37,718 --> 00:24:43,543
Boom 26,000 there you got your third hashtag.
So this is how you go about doing this. So

241
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:49,148
we have content So content and content marketing
are both Stuff you would consider so content

242
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:56,375
marketing seems to have A good number of followers
and content also seems to have a good number

243
00:24:56,395 --> 00:25:01,903
of followers. I'm pretty sure it has quite a
large follow, basically 61,000. So there, we

244
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:05,545
have found our five hashtags. So this is how
you go about doing it. You take a look at the

245
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:13,288
post that you've already written and you do
searches on LinkedIn to identify the most relevant

246
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:20,732
hashtags. Now, over time, you should ideally
be creating a hashtag list of the best hashtags

247
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:27,871
that you can use for your content. And this
is the hashtag sheet in the content analysis

248
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:31,693
sheet. So it's a simple sheet. We just have
the hashtag where you can include the hashtags

249
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:37,075
and the follower count so that over time, you
can build a list of hashtags that have very

250
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:42,898
good followings on LinkedIn. So whenever you
create a post, come in here and drop the hashtags

251
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:48,881
on the follower counts in here. When you're
writing the post itself, so that over time,

252
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:54,944
it'll be very easy for you to just copy paste
hashtags and use them in your content. the

253
00:25:54,964 --> 00:26:02,126
best hashtags with really good follow-ups and
save a lot of time. And now that we're done

254
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:08,529
with hashtags, let's talk a bit about publishing
content on LinkedIn. So publishing process,

255
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:15,372
this part of the video specifically for your
team members who are handling the publishing

256
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:23,096
process. If you're doing this yourself, great.
But this is quite simple. For any kind of content

257
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:27,578
that you wanna publish, you can do it from here.
So all you need to do is click on start a post,

258
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:36,443
which will bring a pop-up. this icon over here
there are all the different media types that

259
00:26:36,463 --> 00:26:41,266
you want to create or include so if you want
to create an event directly from your user

260
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:45,809
profile you can do it here if you want to create
a poll you can do it here if you want to add

261
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:52,254
a carousel or a slide post to your post you
can add it here if you want to add an image

262
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:56,797
or a photo you can do it here if you want to
add a video you can do it here. Let me go through

263
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,057
like say some of the content

264
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:11,184
so that it's easy for you. So this is some sample
post copy that I'm just doing, using for showing

265
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:16,266
you how to create a post. So you add the post,
make sure the line spacing is correct. This

266
00:27:16,306 --> 00:27:22,809
is important. It has to be exactly as it is
in Raptor in ClickUp. So, however it is in

267
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:26,691
ClickUp, I make sure it's come, you come in
here and it's formatted exactly the same way.

268
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:33,675
Sometimes the way this format in ClickUp, when
you copy paste it into LinkedIn, there may

269
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:38,177
be like additional spaces like these. or the
spaces may be absent. So make sure you review

270
00:27:38,197 --> 00:27:45,782
both the ClickUp content card or task and look
at it and come back here and make sure the

271
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:53,147
formatting is exactly the same way. All right,
then make sure that the tags that are included

272
00:27:53,207 --> 00:28:00,412
of people in ClickUp are mentioned the correct
way. So the real tag is suppose I want to include

273
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:08,517
Immortal Tag Captura, which is a company in
here. at the rate and I would select the correct

274
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:14,261
company from here. So in most cases the copywriters
will mention like which company it is in the

275
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:22,167
post copy itself so that you can tag the correct
company in brackets. So make sure that gets

276
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:26,750
done properly. Pay special attention to tagging
the correct company and then if there's any

277
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:32,834
additional details mentioned by the copywriters
in brackets on which our company is to be tagged

278
00:28:32,854 --> 00:28:36,696
or the company page URL or something like that
or the company page username or something like

279
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:41,279
that. Please make sure you remove that bracket
and just tag the correct person. That is just

280
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:47,544
given for reference so that you can tag the
correct companies. And then after you select

281
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:53,467
the correct companies like this, make sure the
spacing is correct, make sure the CTAs are

282
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:59,632
correct, the hashtags selected correctly. So
after you take a quick look at this, look at

283
00:28:59,752 --> 00:29:07,398
formatting options. So formatting is about making
sure points if any bullet points have been

284
00:29:07,438 --> 00:29:12,165
included in ClickUp make sure the bullet points
are mentioned correctly are given correctly

285
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:18,653
so for example if is these three points were
bullet points I have to come in here and manually

286
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:31,099
added this one two three, right? Or if the bullet
points are just not numbered, they're just

287
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,643
normal bullet points, you can come in here and
manually add in here as bullet points in this

288
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:45,870
manner. All right, so please pay special attention
before you hit publish to the formatting. It

289
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:53,638
is very important on LinkedIn. And after you're
done with that, take a look at any media that

290
00:29:53,678 --> 00:29:57,966
is supposed to be added. So if you're just creating
like a text post, so experiential stories,

291
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:06,243
informative posts. engagement page, customer
experience text stories, then if it is a viral

292
00:30:06,283 --> 00:30:13,265
post, it is like viral text post or viral influencer
persona, text post or similar formats, it is

293
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:18,006
all just text. So, in that case, it is this
is a good to go and you can go ahead and schedule

294
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:25,508
a publish directly. But in case there is media
to be added, media can be an image. So, if

295
00:30:25,528 --> 00:30:34,737
it is an image post, it will be included in
the. Clickup task for that specific content

296
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:39,689
piece and in the later videos I will be explaining
how you can how the process differs for each

297
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:47,201
content format. But These three buttons over
here cover almost every single content format

298
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:51,925
that you would want to publish on LinkedIn.
So these are image posts for all posts that

299
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:57,551
include images. Just click on this, click on
select images to share and select the screenshot.

300
00:30:57,571 --> 00:30:59,553
So whatever the screenshot is, you can select
it over here.

301
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:09,199
So here's an image that I'm just using to demonstrate
how it's done. So I just uploaded the image,

302
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:17,302
I can add the post copy in here and then I can
click on this pencil icon over here to. edit

303
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:23,605
it so I can crop the image as I see fit I can
zoom in as I see fit I can straighten or like

304
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:27,847
rotate it as I see fit all of this stuff is
possible I can add filters to the image as

305
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:34,550
well but I can also tag people on the post so
if you're if it's of an event or something

306
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:40,613
like that there's additional team members that
are in the photo or there's additional influencers

307
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:40,933
you took a

308
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:52,158
include them in the post of that they get notifications
that they were tagged in a post and so on just

309
00:31:52,198 --> 00:31:59,142
like how we do on Facebook and so on all of
that stuff can be done in here. For videos

310
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:06,582
there is a small difference that we can also
include thumbnail images for the videos. So

311
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:12,288
let me show you that quickly as well. So I'm
going to drag and drop a video. Okay, that

312
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:18,514
content format is not supported. And we can
see the supported content formats here so that

313
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:23,619
you understand what format the video should
be in and the issue. Let's go back and let

314
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,401
me upload our direct content format.

315
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:36,871
I click on video, I select a test file to upload,
and while it's loading, I can upload a thumbnail.

316
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:41,915
So this is where you click on upload thumbnail
and select the thumbnail image. So you should

317
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:47,260
have downloaded the thumbnail image from the
clicker class to your computer, your laptop

318
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:55,178
or PC, and then uploaded it. And you can also
auto-generate captions if you'd like. and you

319
00:32:55,198 --> 00:32:59,460
can also review the captions before viewers
can see them so you can edit them quickly stuff

320
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,722
through them but in most cases if you're creating
videos we have a subtitling process in the

321
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:09,364
clicker class so there should be or there could
be an SRT file in the clicker class so take

322
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:14,147
a look at it and you can also upload an SRT
file instead of auto generating captions in

323
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:20,029
English all right and once you're done you can
click on done and add the post copy and you're

324
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:20,410
good to go

325
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:32,117
it's a PDF file that you need to upload so you
need to select the document option over here

326
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:36,580
so at the bottom click on the document option
click on choose file and then finally click

327
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,104
on the PDF that you want to upload so I'm taking
this one as an example because it's a PDF I

328
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:49,568
click on open and we can add a title so the
title is displayed in LinkedIn so ideally add

329
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:50,649
like the relevant document

330
00:33:54,612 --> 00:34:00,584
about you can just add that topic in there.
The topic can be the same topic of the clickable

331
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:06,886
task as well and once you are done with that
you can click on done. So let me just enter

332
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:12,929
a text for now. You can enter your own title.
But once you add, upload the PDF and you add

333
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:17,611
the post copy, you can go ahead and schedule
a quick publish. So that's it. This is how

334
00:34:17,671 --> 00:34:23,994
you publish content. Now, the only other thing
that you'll need to do in terms of like after

335
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:30,717
the publishing process is collecting the analytics.
So let's take a look at the posts and see how

336
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:32,018
we can collect the analytics.

337
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,641
Just copying the link to the LinkedIn post,
just click on this button over here at the

338
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:46,102
side of the post and click on copy link to the
post and the post should be, the post link

339
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:50,804
should be copied to your clipboard and then
you can paste them after you publish it to

340
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:59,054
the click of task. And in addition to that if
you want to take a look at the... view counts

341
00:34:59,254 --> 00:35:03,016
so just come to the post and in here you should
be able to see like the impressions you can

342
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:07,558
also see additional stats but you can get the
like count the comment count the repost count

343
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:13,180
as well as the impressions in here if you click
on this button you can also see the analytics

344
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:19,343
for the post if you'd like to see if you'd like
to take a look at additional analytics for

345
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:24,406
your analytics process and you can see viewer
demographics on like say what the job titles

346
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:24,586
are

347
00:35:28,488 --> 00:35:35,291
people that engage with the post and so on.
So this is how you go about collecting analytics

348
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:45,516
and copying post links of the posts and the
content that you publish on LinkedIn. Now content

349
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:51,619
promotion which comes after publishing is an
advanced process. So we are covering it in

350
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:58,595
the later modules. So you will need to progress
after the content creation step. into the growth

351
00:35:58,635 --> 00:35:59,943
hack in your content engine what you will do.

352
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:07,265
understand how to promote your content, learn
how to promote your content. We did cover a

353
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:14,032
quick video on using GlingBoost at the start
of the content marketing modules. So you can

354
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:19,336
use the same process, but we cover far more
detailed processes on how to promote your content

355
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:24,021
manually using manual communities of pods as
well as using automated tools like GlingBoost

356
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:30,983
and GlamPod later on in the program. So you
can either choose to not follow the promotion

357
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:36,772
steps until that stage until you've gotten there
to those videos or you can take a look at those

358
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:41,740
videos right now in the growth acne content
engine and you can start with the promotion

359
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,983
activity as well using manual automated pods.

360
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:56,663
one of the final lessons in this video. is the
times to post. So it is very important that

361
00:36:56,703 --> 00:37:03,026
you go publish your content at the right time
when you receive the most engagement. So what

362
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:09,689
we've done here is in the content format sheet,
we've included the best times to post, a screenshot

363
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:15,992
of the best times to post. These suggested times
come from the LinkedIn algorithm report, which

364
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:21,835
is a statistical study that discovered the best
times to post, when LinkedIn post received

365
00:37:21,855 --> 00:37:28,297
the best engagement. So this is the best data
back source that we have right now on when

366
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:32,739
you will receive the most engagement. Now the
good thing is that we have this but the bad

367
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:38,221
thing is that the times differ on several days.
So if you take a look at Sundays it's from

368
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:44,603
1 p.m. to around 3 p.m. On one days it's from
10 a.m. to around 1 p.m. On Tuesdays it's 8

369
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:52,919
a.m. to around 11 a.m. On Wednesdays it's 9
a.m. to around 12 a.m. I'm sorry 12 p.m. Thursdays

370
00:37:52,959 --> 00:38:02,690
its from 8am to 11am, Fridays from 1pm to 3pm
and Saturdays its from 11pm to 10 a.m. to 1

371
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:09,314
p.m. So you can either choose like a slot that
works on most days and choose to ignore the

372
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:15,076
remaining days. Say for example 10 a.m. is a
time slot that works on most days which is

373
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:22,200
why in most of the coaching calls we recommend
10 a.m. for most of you. But please remember

374
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,142
that these time zones are for the time zones
of your target audience. So if you're located

375
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:27,722
in Europe

376
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:34,446
need to be focusing on the time zones in the
US audience, time zones of the US audience

377
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:40,730
and publishing at 10 am in their time zone.
In similar fashion if you are in the US and

378
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:47,855
you are targeting an audience in EU or the European
Union, you need to be focusing on time zones

379
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:53,619
in the European Union and publishing it at those
time zones at 10 am. So 10 am is just a suggestion,

380
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:58,722
you can choose to publish at the most optimal
time. So the most optimal times for each of

381
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:04,486
these days will be the start of these times.
slots so that's 1 p.m. on Sundays, 10 a.m.

382
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:13,032
on Mondays, 8 a.m. on Tuesdays, 9 a.m. on Wednesdays,
8 a.m. on Thursdays, 1 p.m. on Fridays and

383
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:19,516
10 a.m. on Saturdays. So these are the best
times to post for each of these days. If you're

384
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:25,020
manually publishing this and promoting the content
this will be a bit difficult but the best way

385
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,366
you can structure this process is to set due
dates and reminders and allow. or calendar

386
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:39,414
blockers which is the best option for these
specific times in the calendars of the team

387
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:45,982
members who are handling the posting. So what
I recommend is blocking of your calendars at

388
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:52,561
this exact time. If the strategy you want to
follow is posting at the most optimal times.

389
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:58,729
If for convenience you want to post at the best
time, just add a scheduled calendar blocker

390
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:03,855
at 10 a.m. on every day and just post and promote
and engage on the content during that period.

391
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,737
Now, let us see how to do this. So, let us say
that I have a video on a particular topic.

392
00:40:10,954 --> 00:40:16,596
While replying to comments is an optional part
of this process, especially when you're getting

393
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:21,999
started and you just want to create and promote
a post, this is something that takes a significant

394
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:27,801
amount of time investment. But time and time
again, we've come across creators or participants

395
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:33,124
in the program who have achieved really good
results simply because they were engaging on

396
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:38,366
every single comment. So we've included a process
for this in the click-up boards as well. So

397
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:43,228
after you publish and promote every single post.
Ideally, you should be setting aside the calendar

398
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:48,731
blocker not just for publishing and promoting
the post but also for the time required for

399
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:55,473
engaging with the users that comment. Now which
is why we have.

400
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,473
recommend that those calendar blockers that
you scheduled for the publishing at different

401
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:09,758
times or at the same time every day be for a
minimum of one hour so that after you publish

402
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:15,183
and promote the post you can come in here wait
for the automated pod comments or the manual

403
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:21,388
pod comments or the genuine comments from the
users to trickle in time by time so they'll

404
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:26,359
trickle in like say over the first hour and
Whenever you receive a comment, keep reloading

405
00:41:26,379 --> 00:41:32,843
the page. Whenever you receive a comment, reply
with a really good response. Ideally tag the

406
00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:39,448
people who drop the comment so that they can
come in here, include some questions at the

407
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:40,869
end of the comment on.

408
00:41:44,342 --> 00:41:50,090
their comments so that you can proceed with
the conversation. So here are some examples

409
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,492
of say how we do this. Say for example, say
here, has dropped a comment, I love the idea

410
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,614
of setting expectations on each team member,
I have to ensure that everyone is on the same

411
00:41:57,634 --> 00:42:02,216
page and working towards the same goals. So
we just responded with absolutely setting clear

412
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:05,057
expectations, essentially we're ensuring that
everyone is aligned and working towards the

413
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:10,540
same goals, which can lead to greater success.
We focus on employee happiness is so refreshing,

414
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,122
it gets, it's great to see a leader who sees,
who values their team as people, not just workers.

415
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:20,024
And we respond obviously, thank you for doing
that, app is crucial to creating a positive

416
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:27,626
environment where everyone can thrive and succeed.
So you can also choose to create these comments,

417
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:32,848
these responses to the comments automatically
in CharsgVD. So the process that we teach you

418
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:41,637
in the content promotion videos later on. in
the growth-acquired engine modules, covers

419
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:46,182
the process for creating these comments. All
you need to do is edit that prompt a little

420
00:42:46,202 --> 00:42:52,103
bit. If you also want the... the comments to
be generated here, comments that applies to

421
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:58,005
the comments also to be automatically generated
by ggbt. This is not a process that I would

422
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:01,707
recommend though. This would save you a lot
of time if you just want to do this and just

423
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:07,470
assign it to a team member and not spend a lot
of time or focus on it. But ideally, you should

424
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:12,952
be manually taking a look at every single comment
that comes in and responding manually, engaging

425
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:18,715
with them, liking the comments, reviewing if
these prospects are good prospects. So if C

426
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:23,320
is a good prospect. fits my bypass or not I
could start a conversation with him right now

427
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:32,450
simply because he dropped a comment. So that
sums up this video. where we talked about creating

428
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,691
content in different content formats. We went
through the different elements that make good

429
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:42,552
LinkedIn post copy. We talked about how we'll
be having dedicated videos for each content

430
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:47,074
format later on. We talked about hashtags, how
to publish content on LinkedIn with different

431
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:51,695
media formats, how promotions are advanced tactic
and how we can do it later on in the process.

432
00:43:51,735 --> 00:43:56,596
And finally, we talked about the best times
to post, how to block your calendars for the

433
00:43:56,616 --> 00:44:03,026
best times to post based on the time slots mentioned
in here. which are the most optimal times to

434
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:10,470
post and in the later videos in this module
we will be getting into the dedicated processes

435
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:15,573
for each content format so that you can understand
exactly how to ideate and create content for

436
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:19,675
each of those content formats. That is it for
this video, see you in the next one.
