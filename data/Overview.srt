1
00:00:00,482 --> 00:00:04,865
So in this module, we're going to build the
foundation to your own content strategy using

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:11,029
some hardcore analysis of what your competitors
are doing, what you are doing, and then identify

3
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:15,772
the gaps in your existing content strategy.
When you get started with your own content

4
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:20,155
marketing on LinkedIn, it's important to analyze
and get an understanding of what's working

5
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:24,878
in your industry and then use the insights from
this analysis to craft your own strategy and

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,881
your own content formats. We'll show you how
to do this in this module in a step-by-step

7
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:33,076
manner. We will first do a thorough competitor
analysis to identify competitors and analyze

8
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:36,818
what they are doing with content on different
social media platforms, including LinkedIn

9
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:40,300
and what they are doing on their website. And
we will document them in a sheet called the

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,242
competitor analysis sheet and also segment them
into top of the funnel, middle of the funnel

11
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:49,044
and bottom of the funnel content. Now let me
explain top of the funnel or TOFU a little

12
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:53,327
bit, middle of the funnel or bottom of the funnel
content before we move on. Top of the funnel

13
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:58,290
content includes content that is used to generate
awareness or to provide a service or a product.

14
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:03,442
Middle of the funnel content is content that
is used to convey expertise and thought leadership

15
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:08,486
with content that is useful for our market audience.
And bottom of the funnel content is content

16
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:13,410
that is used to build trust and position our
productive services at the right chance for

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,194
the pain points they are facing. A good content
marketing strategy will include Tofu, MoFu

18
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:25,439
as well as BoFu content formats, which is why
we are analyzing them in-depth and documenting

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,000
them in the Competitor Analysis Sheet. And that's
just the first step. The next step is analyzing

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,524
and documenting our existing content in the
existing content analysis sheet so that we

21
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:41,047
do exactly what we're doing right now and how
our content strategy looks like. And once we're

22
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:46,211
done with both of these steps and then identify
the gaps in our existing content process by

23
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:52,175
looking at what we're doing and what else we
need to do because we now know and understand

24
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:57,074
what our competitors are doing as well. And
finally, We'll also cover the content ideation

25
00:01:57,114 --> 00:02:01,856
sheet, which is where you'll be documenting
a bunch of ideas about your own experiences,

26
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:06,697
as well as some industry theme points and topics
that are interesting to your target audience.

27
00:02:06,717 --> 00:02:11,138
We have two main goals with this module. The
first goal is to analyze exactly what type

28
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:16,400
of content works in our niche or industry so
that we can gain inspiration from it. And the

29
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,370
second goal is to document it in a structured
manner in the content analysis sheets. so that

30
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,912
it can be a valuable resource of inspiration
and ideas for your content team later on. This

31
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:30,775
module will take a total of 15 to 20 hours to
complete and will involve multiple team members

32
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:35,497
and you can find the different steps to completing
this module in the progress tracking sheet

33
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:39,359
as well. It is very important that you get this
module completed within a span of what are

34
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:44,322
two days and the max three days because it will
help you do it way more faster, especially

35
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:48,845
the content gap analysis step. So set aside
some good time over a span of two days, three

36
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:54,058
days and just get it done. You can also choose
to do it slowly, but doing it quickly within

37
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:58,044
2-3 days will help you get it done faster and
save you a couple of thousand work. But by

38
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:02,250
the end of this module, you will be all set
to design your own viral content marketing

39
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,415
strategy that is thought out and data-bound.
That's it for the overview. See you in the

40
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:06,876
next video.
