00:00:01,346 --> 00:00:05,387
So this video is going to be about informative
posts. Now, informative posts, just like the

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:12,470
name sounds, are about, well, informative posts
that shed light on a specific topic. Now, this

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,092
is kind of like a generic content format. There
is nothing very special about this content

4
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:21,414
format. It's just a text post on LinkedIn that
is informative to your target audience on a

5
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:26,356
specific topic that is interesting to your target
audience. So in this case, Sachin is in the

6
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:34,188
crypto space. So he published a post about how
crypto and NFT are becoming common in this sporting

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:40,633
world. And of course, we have a post about it.
So it's a very generic content format. You

8
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:45,757
don't need outlines for this. You can just choose
good topics. So the key thing for Informative

9
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:53,262
Posts are choosing good topics and creating good
hooks. So let's first take a look at the content

10
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:57,545
template for Informative Posts. So the process
starts with you creating a duplicate of this.

11
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:03,236
and then these need to be discussed on the content
ideation calls. You can come up with some informative

12
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:08,918
posts ideas yourself. So you can search for
interesting news. You can search for publications,

13
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:14,380
websites that have active blogs in that specific
industry. You can search and look at competitor

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,543
websites and try to come up with some ideas.
But informative posts are all about industry-specific

15
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:26,545
content that does not have any media format
in them. So you can include images with them,

16
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:32,940
but it's not necessary. It is just a simple
text post that provides information on a specific

17
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:39,704
topic. Now you can add an outline, and you can
discuss it with the executive on the calls.

18
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:45,627
The executive will share some information about
their take on that specific topic. And once

19
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,749
you've beefed out the outline, the content management
process begins with the content manager assigning

20
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:55,753
each of the content tasks. And the content management
process for informative posts works exactly

21
00:01:55,833 --> 00:02:03,602
like an experiencial story, except the post copy
part, everything else is the same, including

22
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:08,750
all the subtasks. So I'm not going to dive deep
into that because it's exactly the same. But

23
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:18,775
let's take a look at how to optimize. Informative
posts. So, informative posts, the key element

24
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:25,518
you need to focus on are hooks, just like usual.
So, go through the hooks. In fact, many of

25
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:30,320
these hooks can be used on informative stories
because there is no restriction on the media

26
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,142
or the content format. They work for almost
all topics. So, go through the hooks, find

27
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:44,526
a suitable hook that works for your topic. And
then after you create the hook for the for

28
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:49,489
the informative posts and write the post out,
then you need to focus on the formatting, which

29
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:54,853
is very important. So the formatting optimization
for informative posts, this section will really

30
00:02:54,873 --> 00:03:00,737
help you. So that's skimming and the other type
of formatting that you can use are concentrating.

31
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:05,340
So both of these, in fact, what you see over
here is an informative post that we covered

32
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,803
in the video. So this was covered in one of
the previous videos called how to create content

33
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:13,765
in different content formats. So rewatch that
video if you'd like, if you'd like to learn

34
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:20,255
more. and revise yourself on the formatting
lessons. But formatting and hooks are all you

35
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:25,859
need for creating informative posts. It's all
about choosing the right topics that are relevant

36
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,043
in the industry, and that is interesting to
your target audience. And that will be shared

37
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:39,451
by your executive on the team, or you can Google
around, you can take a look at competitor websites.

38
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:42,393
So competitors tend to do their own research
and try to come up with interesting.

39
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,424
or you can look at news in the industry. Now
news is very easy. All you need to do is search

40
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:56,588
for a specific keyword and then click on news
in the industry. And you can come up with a

41
00:03:56,628 --> 00:04:01,953
bunch of interesting news topics that you can
use for finding really good informative post

42
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:06,456
ideas. So that's it for this video. I'll see
you in the next one.
