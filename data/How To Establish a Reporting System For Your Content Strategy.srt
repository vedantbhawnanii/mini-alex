1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:07,942
So this is the client report example that I
was talking about. And I'll walk you through

2
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:12,778
this client report and I'll explain each of
the sections. And I'll also explain how you

3
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:20,062
can find each of these metrics. And you can
find a link to this template below the video,

4
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:24,964
the link below the video. And you can just use
it to create your own reports. The design of

5
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:30,206
these reports don't really matter. If you have
an internal tech template that you use for

6
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:34,869
your internal reports, you can ask your team
and you can use that. But the design doesn't

7
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:40,271
really matter. What matters is what are metrics
you report about. Now first, we have an intro

8
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:44,614
slide about, okay, this is the client that we
work with, this is our company and this is

9
00:00:44,654 --> 00:00:49,957
the name of the week, the name of the week,
the date that you created the report for and

10
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:54,980
the logo and stuff, these are the most important
limits, just make sure those are added, the

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,904
rest doesn't really matter, then we have a table
of contents with say the...

12
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:09,016
most important sections in the report so that
you can quickly skim through the report. Again,

13
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:14,478
not really important, but it helps us navigate
the report very quickly if it's a very long

14
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:19,881
report. And over time, it will become quite
long. This slide itself has 38 slides, so over

15
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:25,243
time, the length will increase. So it's better
to include a table of contents that link to

16
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:31,766
the different sections in the report. All right.
Now, let's move on to important links or resources.

17
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:41,352
important resources say for example the content
analysis sheet that you have for your brand,

18
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:46,335
the LinkedIn profiles of the team members, the
website, the Google Drive folder where you

19
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:51,859
stored all the files. So including all of these
in here will make it easy for you to quickly

20
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,683
take looks and make templates and updates, make
updates and assign tasks quickly on the reporting

21
00:01:57,703 --> 00:02:01,886
call itself. So this is something that you should
ideally create, just link every single thing

22
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:08,392
that Make sure that you're linking the profiles.
Make sure that you're linking the content analysis

23
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:12,856
sheet. Make sure that the content character
is separately linked. Make sure that you're

24
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,538
linking the...

25
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:23,136
Login sheet where you're tracking all the logins
to different LinkedIn accounts and so on Make

26
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:26,798
sure that you are linking to the Google Drive
folder and make sure that you're linking to

27
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:32,921
the outreach templates document and make sure
that you're linking to The login sheet where

28
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:37,223
the expanding accounts logins are also added
So that's also important and finally make sure

29
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:42,265
that you're linking to the ClickUp board that
you're using to manage all your content your

30
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:50,129
ClickUp board for each profile in your team
Next we move on to the metrics and the actual

31
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:55,774
report. And we start off with followers and
connection metrics. So this is easy to understand.

32
00:02:55,794 --> 00:03:01,619
Like every week we note down the number of followers
that we have. And this can be found on the

33
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:07,811
LinkedIn profile itself. So on my LinkedIn profile
for example, I can see the number of followers.

34
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:12,573
So I just know that in the event of a number
of followers and we do this every week. So

35
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:16,695
the next week I have something I'll just add
a row or remove this rule, move everything

36
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:23,799
up. And in the new rule, I will add being seven,
the date on which we send tickets and what

37
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,981
the number of followers are. Quite simple. And
the same with the number of connections to

38
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:33,343
find the number of connections. All you need
to do is go to my network. So click on my network.

39
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:39,787
you can see the number over here so it's 28618
in my case it will change every week so that

40
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:43,089
is what we add a number of connections and we
updated everything just like the number of

41
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:49,133
followers and then we have the number of profile
views that of people visiting the profile.

42
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:53,276
Now for the profile view slide what you need
to do is you need to go to your profile there

43
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:57,859
will be a small snippet in here called analytics
and tools and that is all you need to click

44
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,102
on and you should be able to find the profile
views in here you can click on this and this usually 

45
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:08,486
shows you the profile views of the past 90 days. 
So what I'd like you to do is click on past 14 days

46
00:04:08,526 --> 00:04:14,210
because that is a more closer metric as to what
happens what is happening right now but that

47
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,873
is the most you can do so just click on past
14 days click on show results and that is it

48
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:26,658
we get the number of profile viewers and you
can include that in this slide. Moving on next

49
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:33,921
we have the number of SSI score on the profile
so the SSI can be easily found on this URL

50
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:39,768
So that's linkedin.com slash sales slash SSI.
So if you just go there you can find whatever

51
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:49,004
your SSI score is And in my case my SSI score
this week is 69. Okay, that's low not publishing

52
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:53,787
content actively at the moment And you can even
see the components in here. You can go detail

53
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:58,549
and you can include the other elements of this
You can add a screenshot of this every week,

54
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:05,732
but You should at least be reporting the this number 
which is 69 So we include them in here and we mention 

55
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:14,537
whatever week it is and the next metric is content.
So we have the content stats in here. Now for the

56
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:19,160
content stats what we need to include is one
it should have the name of the user profile

57
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,023
so there are multiple people on the team whose
profiles we are creating content on we should

58
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:28,146
be including that but either way we have both
the user profile of the company page to report

59
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:33,209
on. For the content stats so it's better to
just mention the name of the user whose profile

60
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,132
we are reporting on and this is a bunch of columns
in it we have six columns. So first one is

61
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:44,674
the post preview or the title and the link so
we add a name to the whatever the post

62
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,083
post title is, it can be the same name that
you use in ClickUp, but we add a name to the

63
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:55,989
title and we hyperlink it to the LinkedIn post
and then the date on which it was published.

64
00:05:57,186 --> 00:06:01,469
The number of views at the moment as you create
this report the number of reactions or the

65
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:07,914
number of likes the number of comments What
content format it is in so you can easily realize

66
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:13,258
this if, If you go through the content modules
already, but the content format of that piece

67
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:19,964
of content. This should also be visible inside
the ClickUp Content board you can also add

68
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:27,100
the direct link to the ClickUp task for this
specific content piece as well and we should

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,962
be able to find the tags with the content formats
in there and we can also include the content

70
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:37,224
title or the actual content title. So these
are the minimum things that you should be including.

71
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:42,667
You can add additional columns, it's up to you.
But then we do this for all the content pieces

72
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:49,050
and it looks like two of them perform really
well. So that's a good sign. And next we have

73
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,100
the company page, the content stats for the company 
page, we publish two posts on the company page

74
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:59,936
and we have the exact same columns in here as
well with data publishing, the post review,

75
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:04,639
the title and the link. We have the views, the
reactions, the comments, the content format

76
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:10,323
and the content title and in addition to having
this in a tabular format in here so that you

77
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:15,086
can quickly take a look we'll have screenshots
of each of the content pieces so adding screenshots

78
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:22,111
to the content pieces will help us quickly look
at review what exactly was this content piece,

79
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:27,495
like, especially if it's a visual content format.
So we've included screenshots to all of the

80
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:33,118
content pieces that we published as well. And
then we have genuine comments. So genuine comments,

81
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,303
it's good that you track the genuine comments
that you're receiving in some place, but adding

82
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:44,226
screenshots to genuine comments will enable
us to quickly understand, okay, what are the

83
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:49,910
good ones that we need to be looking at? If
there are any leads in here, so just quickly

84
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:59,998
taking a look at the headline will help us understand
which are the... interesting leads that we need

85
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:06,401
to follow up with and we can note them down
as tasks when we discuss this on the weekly

86
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:11,924
reporting card. All right now we have the genuine
comments section so there can be a bunch of

87
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:17,626
slides with the genuine comments and now we have 
the outreach campaign stats. So based on whatever 

88
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:22,889
campaigns you can be running you should be reporting 
a bare minimum of the outreach campaigns at least.

89
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:29,352
So we have the name of the campaign in expandi, what 
the campaign type is in Expandi, the start date of 

90
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:33,614
the campaign, the number of prospects in the campaign,
the number of people who have been contacted, accepted

91
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:39,397
and replied. You can find all these stats in
the expandi campaign screen, so the main

92
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:43,840
campaign screen with the list of all the campaigns.
You can find these stats easily from there.

93
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,123
And we can do this for multiple LinkedIn profiles.
So I'm going to pull up expanding and I'm going

94
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:54,445
to show you how to do this. So here is the expandi
campaign screen.

95
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:03,530
You should only be reporting the active campaign,
so the inactive campaigns you can ignore, but

96
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,412
the active campaign should be reported. And
then the total number of prospects in the campaign,

97
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:10,894
number of people that have been contacted, number
of people who accepted the connection request

98
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:15,997
and replied to the connection request or replied
to others. So all of these are columns that

99
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:21,099
you can include in the reports. And you need
to do this, create different separate slides

100
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,983
for, include all of the campaigns for each profile
that you're running outreach on so that you

101
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:32,572
can take a look at it. to this we also include
stats from each of the campaigns that are active

102
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:39,284
so in addition to documenting the data here
in a tabular format. We also need to include

103
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:46,127
the finer details of the campaign stats. So
let's take a look at how to do this inside

104
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:51,690
the expandi campaigns. So this is an example
expandi campaigns so that I can explain how

105
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,193
to take the screenshot. So we just go to the
campaign and we open the campaign. So we come

106
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:05,706
in here and we click on any one of these campaigns.
So I'm gonna take this one as an example. and

107
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:11,190
I'm going to open it. So let's take a look at
GCWebinar 2 and it'll first load the people

108
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,433
screen by default but click on stats over here
and that'll pull up these screenshots that

109
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:19,936
we need. So take one screenshot of this. You
can take like one combined screenshot of both

110
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:24,239
of this but take someone's screenshot of this
and take one screenshot of this and just drop

111
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:31,845
it as an image in here. I recommend using skitch
to take screenshots. So this is the tool it's

112
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:38,892
called skitch. It's very easy to do this. You
can just select screenshot, control C to copy,

113
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:44,595
and just paste it into the slide, and it's very
easy to create it. So we do this for each campaign

114
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:49,758
that we've reported on in the tables, and we
create a separate slide for each campaign,

115
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:53,920
and there will be a bunch of campaigns that
we are running, so you can include them in

116
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:01,275
here. Now, in addition to this, You can include
additional stats to the screen. So you can

117
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:06,117
select like a weekly stat and you can choose.
It's not an active campaign anymore, but you

118
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:10,860
can include screenshots or metrics that you
come across over here on like the number of

119
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,762
connections requests, emails, endorsements,
like whatever action that you're using that

120
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:21,565
campaign. There's over 15 actions that the expandi
gives you. You can use a report on any of these.

121
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:27,387
It's up to you. But this is the bare minimum
that you should be doing while creating the

122
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:32,631
reporting. Thanks for watching! Now in addition
to the expandi outreach process, if you're

123
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:37,913
sending cold emails or if you're emailing people
for webinar promotion and so on, you should

124
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:42,135
be reporting on that as well. So what we do
is these are all cold emailing campaigns that

125
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:46,437
we run by a mailshake. You can use any cold
emailing software, but the metrics will more

126
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:51,020
or less be the same. So we include the campaign
name, the total number of prospects in the

127
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,182
campaign, the total number of prospects the
email was sent to, the number of emails sent

128
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:59,684
this week, the number of emails engaged this
week. So these are open rates and so on. the

129
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:04,845
number of prospects who replied and the number
of bounces this week and the name and people

130
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:13,506
of name and email of people who replied. We
have redacted this so that it stays confidential

131
00:12:14,427 --> 00:12:19,188
but we have all the campaigns that we are running
on different email platforms as well reported

132
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:25,149
in this manner in here. You can find all these
metrics in most of the outreach tools, most

133
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:32,042
of the email outreach tools that you may be
using and you can include them in here in

134
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:36,004
a weekly manner and keep just like expandi,
we take a look at the active campaigns that

135
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:40,847
are running right now and we report on these
metrics so that we can make decisions on them

136
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:45,989
on the basis of this data that we see in here.
And finally, we move to the to-do section.

137
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:52,032
So at the end of every reporting call, ideally
there should be a bunch of to-dos. So based

138
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:57,774
on what you analyze that you understand from
these metrics, you should be forming your own

139
00:12:57,814 --> 00:13:02,878
opinions on what is working and what is not
working. Say for example, in the content what

140
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:09,124
we noticed is that carousels and this was on
the topic of a belief, lessons from a book

141
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:16,090
called Autobiography of a Yogi that performed
really well because of the hook in the post

142
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,998
and if you see take a look at the hook in the
post it was a... When India was in the brink

143
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:25,860
of independence, one yogi was spending one of
the most important books of the 21st century.

144
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,643
This book seems to have changed both Virat Kohli.
So I guess many of you are not familiar with

145
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:38,446
Virat Kohli, but he is the most followed cricketer
in the world. But Steve Jobs is, well you know

146
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:45,709
who Steve Jobs is. So this post performed really
well. So try to gain opinions and try to gain

147
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:54,174
inferences from why this content piece performed
really well.So whatever is working, try to gain inferences

148
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:59,817
from it and whatever is not working try to gain
inferences from it and note them down in the

149
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:05,901
to-do section in the end. This will be a constant
activity for you for all your reporting calls

150
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:10,304
so you have to take a look at each of these
things and whenever you gain an interesting

151
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:14,907
insight that you want to experiment further
you can note them down in here. So in this

152
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:18,330
case what I've done is since it's just like
six weeks since we began

153
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:25,399
company, we just mentioned carousels and Experiential
Stories performed really well, so this needs

154
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:29,886
to be a fixture on the content calendar. Hooks
need to be analyzed, so I can mention something

155
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:40,696
like hooks need to be analyzed and more of these
type of hooks should be used. So this is good

156
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:48,460
insight for the content manager of the team
who will take a look at this and he will understand

157
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,782
what to do. So in our case it is Akshi and she
is going to be handling this task. So it is

158
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:57,744
a simple structure, we have a to do's intro
slide and then we have a task and we have a

159
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:06,088
status. So it is to be done because it has just been 
discussed. So that is one to do, and these are other To do's 

160
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:11,111
for the overall process. So one is content pieces need
to be approved and calendar accounts need to

161
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:15,134
be integrated. So that is to be shared by the
client's team. So we've just documented all

162
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:20,798
the lessons here. This is a very small to-do
because we took care of most of it but over

163
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:25,701
time ideally your to-dos should be large like
almost every single integrity task that you

164
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:31,405
want to work on. You should be documenting them
in here so that after the call you can move

165
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:34,787
them to your task management platform, assign them as 
tasks to different team members like whoever team members

166
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:40,691
are and then assign it to them so that they
can get started with those tasks and in the

167
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:45,714
next week's report what you should ideally be
doing is make a copy of this report and then

168
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:50,898
update each of these slides with a new metrics
so that's a very easy way to go about this

169
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:55,041
so that the data is in here and again just add
another row for week seven the date and how

170
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:59,904
much it increased or decreased so that's a good
way to create the next week's report as well

171
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:04,065
but this is the weekly reporting structure that I
would recommend for you  

172
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:10,803
This, please note that this is 
a basic template, so this is not like

173
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:17,947
very in depth, this is the bare minimum that
you should be doing, but over time if you need

174
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:23,850
more insights on a specific matrix, say like
you want a link to a sheet where the genuine

175
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:29,932
comments have been tracked, you can include that as 
a separate section in the reporting, in the report.

176
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:36,375
So you can make these notes in here, so that after the 
reporting call, whatever changes you need in this process

177
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:43,920
or any process in your LinkedIn marketing process
can be documented properly and executed. One

178
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,964
of the things I learned over the years working
on LinkedIn is that you will be able to constantly

179
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:53,487
come up with process improvements and gain inferences
from the experiments that you run, but unless

180
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:59,791
you document those inferences and take action
on it, the process will never improve. So just

181
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:06,074
adding this to-do section at the end of the report has 
greatly improved our own process, internally at Growth Club

182
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:12,159
both for our own brand as well as for our clients.
So this is something that you should be actively

183
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:21,325
doing. And that's it for the reporting video.
This is how you create a report. I've included

184
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:26,809
a link to a template in the link below the video.
So you can take a look at that reporting template.

185
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,211
It's in Google Slides. You can make a copy of
it and go ahead and create your own report.

186
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:35,255
If you use an internal tech template, you can
go ahead and use that and just replicate the

187
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:41,865
we have used in this report that I showed you
after watching this video and use that for

188
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:45,491
your weekly reports. See you in the next video.
